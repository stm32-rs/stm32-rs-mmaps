This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty . After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO.

(used for Smartcard mode) -1: DMA is disabled following a reception error. The corresponding error flag is set, as well as RXNE. The DMA request is masked until the error flag is cleared.

This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data has not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and forced by hardware to 0' When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO .

It is cleared by a read to the USARTx_RDR register. The RXNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USARTx_RQR register. RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, and so data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read of the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO.

It is cleared by a write to the USARTx_TDR register. The TXE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the TXFRQ in the USART_RQR register, in order to discard the data (only in Smartcard T=0 mode, in case of transmission failure). When FIFO mode is enabled, TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full, and so data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write in the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO.

It can only be modified using the lock key write sequence. -0: Port configuration lock key not active -1: Port configuration lock key active. The GPIOx_LCKR register is locked until the next MCU reset or peripheral reset. LOCK key write sequence: WR LCKR[16] = 1' + LCKR[15:0] WR LCKR[16] = 0' + LCKR[15:0] WR LCKR[16] = 1' + LCKR[15:0] RD LCKR RD LCKR[16] = 1' (this read operation is optional but it confirms that the lock is active) Note: During the LOCK key write sequence, the value of LCK[15:0] must not change. Any error in the lock sequence aborts the lock. After the first lock sequence on any bit of the port, any read access on the LCKK bit will return 1' until the next MCU reset or peripheral reset

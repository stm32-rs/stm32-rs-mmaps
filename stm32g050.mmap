Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal. Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the TRGO or the TRGO2 signals must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.

It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 00111). If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is ETRF.

0x4000282C C   FIELD 00w15 SUBFS (wo): Subtract a fraction of a second These bits are write only and is always read as zero. Writing to this bit has no effect when a shift operation is pending (when SHPF = 1, in RTC_ICSR). The value which is written to SUBFS is added to the synchronous prescaler counter. Since this counter counts down, this operation effectively subtracts from (delays) the clock by: Delay (seconds) = SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1) A fraction of a second can effectively be added to the clock (advancing the clock) when the ADD1S function is used in conjunction with SUBFS, effectively advancing the clock by: Advance (seconds) = (1 - (SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1))). Note: Writing to SUBFS causes RSF to be cleared. Software can then wait until RSF = 1 to be sure that the shadow registers have been updated with the shifted time.

0x4000441C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NECF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page861). This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.

Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time). This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR.

It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.

0x40012C48 C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x40012C48 C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIMx_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIMx_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data is copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data is transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data is also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

0x40013818 C   FIELD 00w01 ABRRQ (wo): Auto baud rate request Writing 1 to this bit resets the ABRF flag in the USART_ISR and requests an automatic baud rate measurement on the next received data frame. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x40013818 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing '1' to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.
0x4001381C B  REGISTER ISR (ro): Interrupt & status register
0x4001381C C   FIELD 00w01 PE (ro): Parity error This bit is set by hardware when a parity error occurs in receiver mode. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the PECF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if PEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NECF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page861). This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the USART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the USART_CR3 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle Line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. It is set by hardware when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXFE is set. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If TE bit is reset and no transmission is on going, the TC bit is immediately set.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full meaning that data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write operation to the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time). This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR. An interrupt is generated if LBDIE = 1 in the USART_CR2 register. Note: If the USART does not support LIN mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .

Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the nCTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 11w01 RTOF (ro): Receiver timeout This bit is set by hardware when the timeout value, programmed in the RTOR register has lapsed, without any communication. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 12w01 EOBF (ro): End of block flag This bit is set by hardware when a complete block has been received (for example T=1 Smartcard mode). The detection is done when the number of received bytes (from the start of the block, including the prologue) is equal or greater than BLEN + 4. An interrupt is generated if the EOBIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the EOBCF in the USART_ICR register. Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x4001381C C   FIELD 13w01 UDR (ro): SPI slave underrun error flag In slave transmission mode, this flag is set when the first clock pulse for data transmission appears while the software has not yet loaded any value into USART_TDR. This flag is reset by setting UDRCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: If the USART does not support the SPI slave mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x4001381C C   FIELD 14w01 ABRE (ro): Auto baud rate error This bit is set by hardware if the baud rate measurement failed (baud rate out of range or character comparison failed) It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ bit in the USART_CR3 register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 15w01 ABRF (ro): Auto baud rate flag This bit is set by hardware when the automatic baud rate has been set (RXFNE is also set, generating an interrupt if RXFNEIE = 1) or when the auto baud rate operation was completed without success (ABRE=1) (ABRE, RXFNE and FE are also set in this case) It is cleared by software, in order to request a new auto baud rate detection, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 16w01 BUSY (ro): Busy flag This bit is set and reset by hardware. It is active when a communication is ongoing on the RX line (successful start bit detected). It is reset at the end of the reception (successful or not).

0x4001381C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the USART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x4001381C C   FIELD 20w01 WUF (ro): Wakeup from low-power mode flag This bit is set by hardware, when a wakeup event is detected. The event is defined by the WUS bitfield. It is cleared by software, writing a 1 to the WUCF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if WUFIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When UESM is cleared, WUF flag is also cleared. If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x4001381C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the USART.

0x4001381C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used to verify that the USART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to .
0x4001381C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared. The TXFE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the bit TXFRQ (bit 4) in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if the TXFEIE bit =1 (bit 30) in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 24w01 RXFF (ro): RXFIFO full This bit is set by hardware when the number of received data corresponds to RXFIFOsize+1 (RXFIFO full + 1 data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register.

This means that there are (RXFTCFG - 1) data in the Receive FIFO and one data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFTIE bit =1 (bit 27) in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When the RXFTCFG threshold is configured to '101', RXFT flag is set if 16 data are available i.e. 15 data in the RXFIFO and 1 data in the USART_RDR. Consequently, the 17th received data does not cause an overrun error. The overrun error occurs after receiving the 18th data.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 27w01 TXFT (ro): TXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the TXFIFO reaches the threshold programmed in TXFTCFG of USART_CR3 register i.e. the TXFIFO contains TXFTCFG empty locations.

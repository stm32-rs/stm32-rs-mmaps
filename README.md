# STM32 Peripheral Access Crates - Memory Maps

This repository contains automated builds of memory maps of the
[stm32-rs](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs) crates, built
on pushes to master and on pull requests, to allow easily viewing
the effect of a pull request on the generated memory maps.

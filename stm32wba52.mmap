0x40000004 C   FIELD 04w03 MMS (rw): MMS[0]: Master mode selection These bits allow to select the information to be sent in master mode to slave timers for synchronization (tim_trgo). The combination is as follows: When the Counter Enable signal is controlled by the trigger input, there is a delay on tim_trgo, except if the master/slave mode is selected (see the MSM bit description in TIMx_SMCR register). Others: Reserved Note: The clock of the slave timer or ADC must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.

0x40000008 C   FIELD 00w03 SMS (rw): SMS[0]: Slave mode selection When external signals are selected the active edge of the trigger signal (tim_trgi) is linked to the polarity selected on the external input (see Input Control register and Control Register description. Note: The gated mode must not be used if tim_ti1f_ed is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, tim_ti1f_ed outputs 1 pulse for each transition on tim_ti1f, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal. Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the tim_trgo signal must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.
0x40000008 C   FIELD 03w01 OCCS (rw): OCREF clear selection This bit is used to select the OCREF clear source Note: If the OCREF clear selection feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and forced by hardware to '0'. Section 29.3: TIM2/TIM3 implementation.

0x40000008 C   FIELD 12w02 ETPS (rw): External trigger prescaler External trigger signal tim_etrp frequency must be at most 1/4 of tim_ker_ck frequency. A prescaler can be enabled to reduce tim_etrp frequency. It is useful when inputting fast external clocks on tim_etr_in.
0x40000008 C   FIELD 14w01 ECE (rw): External clock enable This bit enables External clock mode 2. Setting the ECE bit has the same effect as selecting external clock mode 1 with tim_trgi connected to tim_etrf (SMS=111 and TS=00111). It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, tim_trgi must not be connected to tim_etrf in this case (TS bits must not be 00111). Note: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is tim_etrf.
0x40000008 C   FIELD 15w01 ETP (rw): External trigger polarity This bit selects whether tim_etr_in or tim_etr_in is used for trigger operations

0x400003DC B  REGISTER DCR (rw): TIM DMA control register
0x400003DC C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x400003DC C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on.

0x40000404 C   FIELD 04w03 MMS (rw): MMS[0]: Master mode selection These bits allow to select the information to be sent in master mode to slave timers for synchronization (tim_trgo). The combination is as follows: When the Counter Enable signal is controlled by the trigger input, there is a delay on tim_trgo, except if the master/slave mode is selected (see the MSM bit description in TIMx_SMCR register). Others: Reserved Note: The clock of the slave timer or ADC must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.

Note: The gated mode must not be used if tim_ti1f_ed is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, tim_ti1f_ed outputs 1 pulse for each transition on tim_ti1f, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal. Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the tim_trgo signal must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.
0x40000408 C   FIELD 03w01 OCCS (rw): OCREF clear selection This bit is used to select the OCREF clear source Note: If the OCREF clear selection feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and forced by hardware to '0'. Section 29.3: TIM2/TIM3 implementation.

Setting the ECE bit has the same effect as selecting external clock mode 1 with tim_trgi connected to tim_etrf (SMS=111 and TS=00111). It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, tim_trgi must not be connected to tim_etrf in this case (TS bits must not be 00111). Note: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is tim_etrf.

If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

0x40003000 C   FIELD 00w16 KEY (wo): Key value (write only, read 0x0000) These bits must be written by software at regular intervals with the key value 0xAAAA, otherwise the watchdog generates a reset when the counter reaches 0. Writing the key value 0x5555 to enable access to the IWDG_PR, IWDG_RLR and IWDG_WINR registers (see Section 29.4.6: Register access protection) Writing the key value 0xCCCC starts the watchdog (except if the hardware watchdog option is selected)

They are written by software to select the prescaler divider feeding the counter clock. PVU bit of the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset in order to be able to change the prescaler divider. Others: divider / 1024 Note: Reading this register returns the prescaler value from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing. For this reason the value read from this register is valid only when the PVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.

0x40003008 C   FIELD 00w12 RL (rw): Watchdog counter reload value These bits are write access protected see Register access protection. They are written by software to define the value to be loaded in the watchdog counter each time the value 0xAAAA is written in the IWDG key register (IWDG_KR). The watchdog counter counts down from this value. The timeout period is a function of this value and the prescaler.clock. It is not recommended to set RL[11:0] to a value lower than 2. The RVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the reload value from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing on it. For this reason the value read from this register is valid only when the RVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.

0x4000300C C   FIELD 00w01 PVU (ro): Watchdog prescaler value update This bit is set by hardware to indicate that an update of the prescaler value is ongoing. It is reset by hardware when the prescaler update operation is completed in the VsubDD/sub voltage domain (takes up to three periods of the IWDG kernel clock iwdg_ker_ck). The prescaler value can be updated only when PVU bit is reset.
0x4000300C C   FIELD 01w01 RVU (ro): Watchdog counter reload value update This bit is set by hardware to indicate that an update of the reload value is ongoing. It is reset by hardware when the reload value update operation is completed in the VsubDD/sub voltage domain (takes up to three periods of the IWDG kernel clock iwdg_ker_ck).

It is reset by hardware when the update operation is completed in the VsubDD/sub voltage domain (takes up to three periods of the IWDG kernel clock iwdg_ker_ck). The EWIT[11:0] and EWIE fields can be updated only when EWU bit is reset.

0x40003010 C   FIELD 00w12 WIN (rw): Watchdog counter window value These bits are write access protected, see Section 29.4.6, they contain the high limit of the window value to be compared with the downcounter. To prevent a reset, the IWDCNT downcounter must be reloaded when its value is lower than WIN[11:0]+1 and greater than 1. The WVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the reload value from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing. For this reason the value read from this register is valid only when the WVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.

0x40003014 C   FIELD 00w12 EWIT (rw): Watchdog counter window value These bits are write access protected (see Section 29.4.6). They are written by software to define at which position of the IWDCNT down-counter the early wakeup interrupt must be generated. The early interrupt is generated when the IWDCNT is lower or equal to EWIT[11:0] - 1. EWIT[11:0] must be bigger than 1. An interrupt is generated only if EWIE = 1. The EWU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the Early wakeup comparator value and the Interrupt enable bit from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing, hence the value read from this register is valid only when the EWU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.
0x40003014 C   FIELD 14w01 EWIC (wo): Watchdog early interrupt acknowledge The software must write a 1 into this bit in order to acknowledge the early wakeup interrupt and to clear the EWIF flag. Writing 0 has not effect, reading this flag returns a 0.

The USART configuration is kept, but all the USART_ISR status flags are reset. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: To enter low-power mode without generating errors on the line, the TE bit must be previously reset and the software must wait for the TC bit in the USART_ISR to be set before resetting the UE bit. Note: The DMA requests are also reset when UE = 0 so the DMA channel must be disabled before resetting the UE bit. Note: In Smartcard mode, (SCEN = 1), the CK is always available when CLKEN = 1, regardless of the UE bit value.

When the Autonomous mode is used, TE bit becomes a status bit, which is set and cleared by hardware. Note: During transmission, a low pulse on the TE bit (0 followed by 1) sends a preamble (idle line) after the current word, except in Smartcard mode. In order to generate an idle character, the TE must not be immediately written to 1. To ensure the required duration, the software can poll the TEACK bit in the USART_ISR register. Note: In Smartcard mode, when TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.

0x40004408 C   FIELD 12w01 OVRDIS (rw): Overrun Disable This bit is used to disable the receive overrun detection. the ORE flag is not set and the new received data overwrites the previous content of the USART_RDR register. When FIFO mode is enabled, the RXFIFO is bypassed and data are written directly in USART_RDR register. Even when FIFO management is enabled, the RXNE flag is to be used. This bit can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: This control bit enables checking the communication flow w/o reading the data

The value given in the register (5 significant bits) is multiplied by 2 to give the division factor of the source clock frequency: ... This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: Bits [7:5] must be kept cleared if Smartcard mode is used. Note: This bitfield is reserved and forced by hardware to 0 when the Smartcard and IrDA modes are not supported. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.

The Transmission Complete flag is set after this guard time value. This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x40004414 B  REGISTER RTOR (rw): USART receiver timeout register
0x40004414 C   FIELD 00w24 RTO (rw): Receiver timeout value This bitfield gives the Receiver timeout value in terms of number of bit duration. In Standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
0x40004414 C   FIELD 24w08 BLEN (rw): Block Length This bitfield gives the Block length in Smartcard T=1 Reception. Its value equals the number of information characters + the length of the Epilogue Field (1-LEC/2-CRC) - 1. Examples: BLEN = 0 - 0 information characters + LEC BLEN = 1 - 0 information characters + CRC BLEN = 255 - 254 information characters + CRC (total 256 characters)) In Smartcard mode, the Block length counter is reset when TXE=0 (TXFE = 0 in case FIFO mode is enabled). This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE=0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.
0x40004418 B  REGISTER RQR (wo): USART request register
0x40004418 C   FIELD 00w01 ABRRQ (wo): Auto baud rate request Writing 1 to this bit resets the ABRF and ABRE flags in the USART_ISR and requests an automatic baud rate measurement on the next received data frame. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x40004418 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x40004418 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x40004418 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x40004418 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.
0x4000441C B  REGISTER ISR (ro): USART interrupt and status register [alternate]
0x4000441C C   FIELD 00w01 PE (ro): Parity error This bit is set by hardware when a parity error occurs in Reception mode. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the PECF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if PEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Section 78.5.9: Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page 4584). Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the USART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the USART_CR3 register.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle Line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXE/TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by writing to the USART_TDR register.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full meaning that data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write operation to the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE is set at the same time). Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR. An interrupt is generated if LBDIE = 1 in the USART_CR2 register. Note: If the USART does not support LIN mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the CTSCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CTSIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the CTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 11w01 RTOF (ro): Receiver timeout This bit is set by hardware when the timeout value, programmed in the RTOR register has lapsed, without any communication. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. Note: The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. Note: If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 12w01 EOBF (ro): End of block flag This bit is set by hardware when a complete block has been received (for example T=1 Smartcard mode). The detection is done when the number of received bytes (from the start of the block, including the prologue) is equal or greater than BLEN + 4. An interrupt is generated if EOBIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to EOBCF in the USART_ICR register. Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 13w01 UDR (ro): SPI slave underrun error flag In Slave transmission mode, this flag is set when the first clock pulse for data transmission appears while the software has not yet loaded any value into USART_TDR. This flag is reset by setting UDRCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: If the USART does not support the SPI slave mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 14w01 ABRE (ro): Auto baud rate error This bit is set by hardware if the baud rate measurement failed (baud rate out of range or character comparison failed) It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 15w01 ABRF (ro): Auto baud rate flag This bit is set by hardware when the automatic baud rate has been set (RXFNE is also set, generating an interrupt if RXFNEIE = 1) or when the auto baud rate operation was completed without success (ABRE=1) (ABRE, RXFNE and FE are also set in this case) It is cleared by software, in order to request a new auto baud rate detection, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 16w01 BUSY (ro): Busy flag This bit is set and reset by hardware. It is active when a communication is ongoing on the RX line (successful start bit detected). It is reset at the end of the reception (successful or not).

0x4000441C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the USART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used when an idle frame request is generated by writing TE=0, followed by TE=1 in the USART_CR1 register, in order to respect the TE=0 minimum period.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used to verify that the USART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO Empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is Empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared. The TXFE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the bit TXFRQ (bit 4) in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if the TXFEIE bit =1 (bit 30) in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 24w01 RXFF (ro): RXFIFO Full This bit is set by hardware when the number of received data corresponds to RXFIFO size + 1 (RXFIFO full + 1 data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 25w01 TCBGT (ro): Transmission complete before guard time flag This bit is set when the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted correctly out of the shift register. It is set by hardware in Smartcard mode, if the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and if the smartcard did not send back any NACK. An interrupt is generated if TCBGTIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. This bit is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCBGTCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If the USART does not support the Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. If the USART supports the Smartcard mode and the Smartcard mode is enabled, the TCBGT reset value is 1. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 26w01 RXFT (ro): RXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the threshold programmed in RXFTCFG in USART_CR3 register is reached. This means that there are (RXFTCFG - 1) data in the Receive FIFO and one data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFTIE bit =1 (bit 27) in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When the RXFTCFG threshold is configured to 101, RXFT flag is set if 16 data are available i.e. 15 data in the RXFIFO and 1 data in the USART_RDR. Consequently, the 17th received data does not cause an overrun error. The overrun error occurs after receiving the 18th data.
0x4000441C C   FIELD 27w01 TXFT (ro): TXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the TXFIFO reaches the threshold programmed in TXFTCFG of USART_CR3 register i.e. the TXFIFO contains TXFTCFG empty locations.

0x40004424 B  REGISTER RDR (ro): USART receive data register
0x40004424 C   FIELD 00w09 RDR (ro): Receive data value Contains the received data character. The RDR register provides the parallel interface between the input shift register and the internal bus (see Figure 927).

0x40004428 B  REGISTER TDR (rw): USART transmit data register
0x40004428 C   FIELD 00w09 TDR (rw): Transmit data value Contains the data character to be transmitted. The USART_TDR register provides the parallel interface between the internal bus and the output shift register (see Figure 927). When transmitting with the parity enabled (PCE bit set to 1 in the USART_CR1 register), the value written in the MSB (bit 7 or bit 8 depending on the data length) has no effect because it is replaced by the parity.

0x40012FDC C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x40012FDC C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

0x40013000 C   FIELD 00w01 SPE (rw): serial peripheral enable This bit is set by and cleared by software. When SPE = 1, SPI data transfer is enabled, SPI_CFG1 and SPI_CFG2 configuration registers, CRCPOLY, UDRDR, part of SPI_AUTOCR register and IOLOCK bit in the SPI_CR1 register are write protected. They can be changed only when SPE = 0. When SPE = 0 any SPI operation is stopped and disabled, all the pending requests of the events with enabled interrupt are blocked except the MODF interrupt request (but their pending still propagates the request of the spi_plck clock), the SS output is deactivated at master, the RDY signal keeps not ready status at slave, the internal state machine is reseted, all the FIFOs content is flushed, CRC calculation initialized, receive data register is read zero. SPE is cleared and cannot be set when MODF error flag is active.
0x40013000 C   FIELD 08w01 MASRX (rw): master automatic suspension in Receive mode This bit is set and cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition. When SPI communication is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay. This is why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared, the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent any subsequent suspension.
0x40013000 C   FIELD 09w01 CSTART (rw): master transfer start This bit can be set by software if SPI is enabled only to start an SPI communication. it is cleared by hardware when end of transfer (EOT) flag is set or when a transaction suspend request is accepted.

0x40013000 C   FIELD 10w01 CSUSP (wo): master suspend request This bit reads as zero. In Master mode, when this bit is set by software, the CSTART bit is reset at the end of the current frame and communication is suspended. The user has to check SUSP flag to check end of the frame transaction. The Master mode communication must be suspended (using this bit or keeping TXDR empty) before going to Low-power mode. Can be used in SPI or I2S mode. After software suspension, SUSP flag must be cleared and SPI disabled and re-enabled before the next transaction starts.

0x40013014 B  REGISTER SR: SPI status register
0x40013014 C   FIELD 00w01 RXP (ro): Rx-Packet available In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: RxFIFO level is lower than FTHLV In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: RxFIFO level is higher or equal to FTHLV RXP flag is changed by hardware. It monitors number of overall data currently available at RxFIFO if SPI is enabled. It must be checked once a data packet is completely read out from RxFIFO.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 01w01 TXP (ro): Tx-Packet space available In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: there is less than FTHLV free locations in the TxFIFO In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: there is FTHLV or more than FTHLV free locations in the TxFIFO TXP flag is changed by hardware. It monitors overall space currently available at TxFIFO no matter if SPI is enabled or not. It must be checked once a complete data packet is stored at TxFIFO.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 02w01 DXP (ro): duplex packet DXP flag is set whenever both TXP and RXP flags are set regardless SPI mode.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 03w01 EOT (ro): end of transfer EOT is set by hardware as soon as a full transfer is complete, that is when SPI is re-enabled or when TSIZE number of data have been transmitted and/or received on the SPI. EOT is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to EOTC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. EOT flag triggers an interrupt if EOTIE bit is set. If DXP flag is used until TXTF flag is set and DXPIE is cleared, EOT can be used to download the last packets contained into RxFIFO in one-shot. In master, EOT event terminates the data transaction and handles SS output optionally. When CRC is applied, the EOT event is extended over the CRC frame transaction. To restart the internal state machine properly, SPI is strongly suggested to be disabled and re-enabled before next transaction starts despite its setting is not changed.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 04w01 TXTF (ro): transmission transfer filled TXTF is set by hardware as soon as all of the data packets in a transfer have been submitted for transmission by application software or DMA, that is when TSIZE number of data have been pushed into the TxFIFO. This bit is cleared by software write 1 to TXTFC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively. TXTF flag triggers an interrupt if TXTFIE bit is set. TXTF setting clears the TXPIE and DXPIE masks so to off-load application software from calculating when to disable TXP and DXP interrupts.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 05w01 UDR (ro): underrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to UDRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. Note: In SPI mode, the UDR flag applies to Slave mode only. In I2S/PCM mode, (when available) this flag applies to Master and Slave mode
0x40013014 C   FIELD 06w01 OVR (ro): overrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to OVRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally.

0x40013014 C   FIELD 09w01 MODF (ro): mode fault This bit is cleared by writing 1 to MODFC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 11w01 SUSP (ro): suspension status In Master mode, SUSP is set by hardware either as soon as the current frame is completed after CSUSP request is done or at master automatic suspend receive mode (MASRX bit is set at SPI_CR1 register) on RxFIFO full condition. SUSP generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set. This bit must be cleared prior SPI is disabled and this is done by writing 1 to SUSPC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 12w01 TXC (ro): TxFIFO transmission complete The flag behavior depends on TSIZE setting. When TSIZE = 0 the TXC is changed by hardware exclusively and it raises each time the TxFIFO becomes empty and there is no activity on the bus. If TSIZE different 0 there is no specific reason to monitor TXC as it just copies the EOT flag value including its software clearing. The TXC generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 13w02 RXPLVL (ro): RxFIFO packing level When RXWNE = 0 and data size is set up to 16-bit, the value gives number of remaining data frames persisting at RxFIFO. Note: (*): Optional value when data size is set up to 8-bit only. When data size is greater than 16-bit, these bits are always read as 00. In that consequence, the single data frame received at the FIFO cannot be detected neither by RWNE nor by RXPLVL bits if data size is set from 17 to 24 bits. The user then must apply other methods like TSIZE 0 or FTHLV = 0.
0x40013014 C   FIELD 15w01 RXWNE (ro): RxFIFO word not empty Note: This bit value does not depend on DSIZE setting and keeps together with RXPLVL[1:0] information about RxFIFO occupancy by residual data.

0x40013040 B  REGISTER CRCPOLY: SPI polynomial register
0x40013040 C   FIELD 00w32 CRCPOLY (rw): CRC polynomial register This register contains the polynomial for the CRC calculation. The default 9-bit polynomial setting 0x107 corresponds to default 8-bit setting of DSIZE. It is compatible with setting 0x07 used in other ST products with fixed length of the polynomial string, where the most significant bit of the string is always kept hidden. Length of the polynomial is given by the most significant bit of the value stored in this register. It must be set greater than DSIZE. CRC33_17 bit must be set additionally with CRCPOLY register when DSIZE is configured to maximum 32-bit or 16-bit size and CRC is enabled (to keep polynomial length grater than data size). Note: CRCPOLY[31:16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.
0x40013044 B  REGISTER TXCRC: SPI transmitter CRC register
0x40013044 C   FIELD 00w32 TXCRC (ro): CRC register for transmitter When CRC calculation is enabled, the TXCRC[31:0] bits contain the computed CRC value of the subsequently transmitted bytes. CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: TXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored. Note: The configuration of CRCSIZE bit field is not taken into account when the content of this register is read by software. No masking is applied for unused bits in this case.

CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: RXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

Note: UDRDR[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constraint when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

0x40013800 B  REGISTER CR1 (rw): USART control register 1 [alternate]
0x40013800 C   FIELD 00w01 UE (rw): USART enable When this bit is cleared, the USART prescalers and outputs are stopped immediately, and all current operations are discarded. The USART configuration is kept, but all the USART_ISR status flags are reset. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: To enter low-power mode without generating errors on the line, the TE bit must be previously reset and the software must wait for the TC bit in the USART_ISR to be set before resetting the UE bit. Note: The DMA requests are also reset when UE = 0 so the DMA channel must be disabled before resetting the UE bit. Note: In Smartcard mode, (SCEN = 1), the CK is always available when CLKEN = 1, regardless of the UE bit value.
0x40013800 C   FIELD 01w01 UESM (rw): USART enable in low-power mode When this bit is cleared, the USART cannot request its kernel clock and is not functional in low-power mode.

When the Autonomous mode is used, TE bit becomes a status bit, which is set and cleared by hardware. Note: During transmission, a low pulse on the TE bit (0 followed by 1) sends a preamble (idle line) after the current word, except in Smartcard mode. In order to generate an idle character, the TE must not be immediately written to 1. To ensure the required duration, the software can poll the TEACK bit in the USART_ISR register. Note: In Smartcard mode, when TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.

It is expressed in sample time units (1/8 or 1/16 bit time, depending on the oversampling rate). If the USART_TDR register is written during the DEDT time, the new data is transmitted only when the DEDT and DEAT times have both elapsed. This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: If the Driver Enable feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x40013800 C   FIELD 21w05 DEAT (rw): Driver Enable assertion time This 5-bit value defines the time between the activation of the DE (Driver Enable) signal and the beginning of the start bit.

When this feature is enabled, the RTOF flag in the USART_ISR register is set if the RX line is idle (no reception) for the duration programmed in the RTOR (receiver timeout register). Note: If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x40013804 C   FIELD 24w08 ADD (rw): Address of the USART node These bits give the address of the USART node in Mute mode or a character code to be recognized in low-power or Run mode: In Mute mode: they are used in multiprocessor communication to wakeup from Mute mode with 4-bit/7-bit address mark detection.

In Run mode with Mute mode inactive (for example, end-of-block detection in ModBus protocol): the whole received character (8 bits) is compared to ADD[7:0] value and CMF flag is set on match. An interrupt is generated if the CMIE bit is set. These bits can only be written when the reception is disabled (RE = 0) or when the USART is disabled (UE = 0).

0x40013814 C   FIELD 00w24 RTO (rw): Receiver timeout value This bitfield gives the Receiver timeout value in terms of number of bit duration. In Standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
0x40013814 C   FIELD 24w08 BLEN (rw): Block Length This bitfield gives the Block length in Smartcard T=1 Reception. Its value equals the number of information characters + the length of the Epilogue Field (1-LEC/2-CRC) - 1. Examples: BLEN = 0 - 0 information characters + LEC BLEN = 1 - 0 information characters + CRC BLEN = 255 - 254 information characters + CRC (total 256 characters)) In Smartcard mode, the Block length counter is reset when TXE=0 (TXFE = 0 in case FIFO mode is enabled). This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE=0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.
0x40013818 B  REGISTER RQR (wo): USART request register
0x40013818 C   FIELD 00w01 ABRRQ (wo): Auto baud rate request Writing 1 to this bit resets the ABRF and ABRE flags in the USART_ISR and requests an automatic baud rate measurement on the next received data frame. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x40013818 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.
0x4001381C B  REGISTER ISR (ro): USART interrupt and status register [alternate]
0x4001381C C   FIELD 00w01 PE (ro): Parity error This bit is set by hardware when a parity error occurs in Reception mode. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the PECF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if PEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Section 78.5.9: Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page 4584). Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the USART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the USART_CR3 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle Line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXE/TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by writing to the USART_TDR register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full meaning that data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write operation to the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE is set at the same time). Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR.

Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the CTSCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CTSIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the CTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 11w01 RTOF (ro): Receiver timeout This bit is set by hardware when the timeout value, programmed in the RTOR register has lapsed, without any communication. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. Note: The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. Note: If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 12w01 EOBF (ro): End of block flag This bit is set by hardware when a complete block has been received (for example T=1 Smartcard mode). The detection is done when the number of received bytes (from the start of the block, including the prologue) is equal or greater than BLEN + 4. An interrupt is generated if EOBIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to EOBCF in the USART_ICR register. Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.

This flag is reset by setting UDRCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: If the USART does not support the SPI slave mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 14w01 ABRE (ro): Auto baud rate error This bit is set by hardware if the baud rate measurement failed (baud rate out of range or character comparison failed) It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 15w01 ABRF (ro): Auto baud rate flag This bit is set by hardware when the automatic baud rate has been set (RXFNE is also set, generating an interrupt if RXFNEIE = 1) or when the auto baud rate operation was completed without success (ABRE=1) (ABRE, RXFNE and FE are also set in this case) It is cleared by software, in order to request a new auto baud rate detection, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 16w01 BUSY (ro): Busy flag This bit is set and reset by hardware. It is active when a communication is ongoing on the RX line (successful start bit detected). It is reset at the end of the reception (successful or not).

0x4001381C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the USART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used when an idle frame request is generated by writing TE=0, followed by TE=1 in the USART_CR1 register, in order to respect the TE=0 minimum period.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used to verify that the USART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO Empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is Empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared. The TXFE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the bit TXFRQ (bit 4) in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if the TXFEIE bit =1 (bit 30) in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 24w01 RXFF (ro): RXFIFO Full This bit is set by hardware when the number of received data corresponds to RXFIFO size + 1 (RXFIFO full + 1 data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 25w01 TCBGT (ro): Transmission complete before guard time flag This bit is set when the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted correctly out of the shift register. It is set by hardware in Smartcard mode, if the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and if the smartcard did not send back any NACK. An interrupt is generated if TCBGTIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. This bit is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCBGTCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If the USART does not support the Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. If the USART supports the Smartcard mode and the Smartcard mode is enabled, the TCBGT reset value is 1. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x4001381C C   FIELD 26w01 RXFT (ro): RXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the threshold programmed in RXFTCFG in USART_CR3 register is reached. This means that there are (RXFTCFG - 1) data in the Receive FIFO and one data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFTIE bit =1 (bit 27) in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When the RXFTCFG threshold is configured to 101, RXFT flag is set if 16 data are available i.e. 15 data in the RXFIFO and 1 data in the USART_RDR. Consequently, the 17th received data does not cause an overrun error. The overrun error occurs after receiving the 18th data.

0x40020064 C   FIELD 00w01 EN (rw): enable Writing 1 into the field RESET (bit 1) causes the hardware to de-assert this bit, whatever is written into this bit 0. Else: this bit is deasserted by hardware when there is a transfer error (master bus error or user setting error) or when there is a channel transfer complete (channel ready to be configured, for example if LSM=1 at the end of a single execution of the LLI). Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x40020064 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).
0x40020064 C   FIELD 02w01 SUSP (rw): suspend Writing 1 into the field RESET (bit 1) causes the hardware to de-assert this bit, whatever is written into this bit 2.

A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]).

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size. Transfer performance is lower, with GPDMA re-arbitration between effective and lower singles/bursts, but the data integrity is guaranteed.

When GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx is deasserted, this SSEC bit is also deasserted by hardware (on a secure reconfiguration of the channel as non-secure), and the GPDMA transfer from the source is non-secure.
0x40020090 C   FIELD 16w02 DDW_LOG2 (rw): binary logarithm of the destination data width of a burst, in bytes Setting a 8-byte data width causes a user setting error to be reported and none transfer is issued.

Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer. Note: A non-null source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: When configured in packing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.PAM[1] = 1 and destination data width different from source data width), a non-null source block size must be a multiple of the destination data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0]).

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x400200E4 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).
0x400200E4 C   FIELD 02w01 SUSP (rw): suspend Writing 1 into the field RESET (bit 1) causes the hardware to de-assert this bit, whatever is written into this bit 2. Else: Software must write 1 in order to suspend an active channel (channel with an ongoing GPDMA transfer over its master ports). The software must write 0 in order to resume a suspended channel, following the programming sequence detailed in Figure 43.

0x40020110 C   FIELD 00w02 SDW_LOG2 (rw): binary logarithm of the source data width of a burst in bytes Setting a 8-byte data width causes a user setting error to be reported and no transfer is issued. A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and none transfer is issued.

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size. Transfer performance is lower, with GPDMA re-arbitration between effective and lower singles/bursts, but the data integrity is guaranteed.

When GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx is deasserted, this SSEC bit is also deasserted by hardware (on a secure reconfiguration of the channel as non-secure), and the GPDMA transfer from the source is non-secure.
0x40020110 C   FIELD 16w02 DDW_LOG2 (rw): binary logarithm of the destination data width of a burst, in bytes Setting a 8-byte data width causes a user setting error to be reported and none transfer is issued.

Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] =0 ), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLIsub1/sub.

Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer. Note: A non-null source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: When configured in packing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.PAM[1] = 1 and destination data width different from source data width), a non-null source block size must be a multiple of the destination data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0]).

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1. Note: A source address must be aligned with the programmed data width of a source burst (SA[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x40020164 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] =0 ), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLIsub1/sub.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC.

Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

0x400202E4 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x40020364 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]).

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x400203E4 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]).

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode.

0x420C0004 C   FIELD 02w01 WRERRF (ro): Write error flag This bit is set when an unexpected write to the AES_DINR register occurred. When set WRERRF bit has no impact on the AES operations. This flag is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit in AES_ICR register. If RWEIE bit is set in AES_IER register an interrupt is generated when WRERRF is set. It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the AES_ICR register.
0x420C0004 C   FIELD 03w01 BUSY (ro): Busy This flag indicates whether AES is idle or busy. AES is flagged as idle when disabled or when the last processing is completed. AES is flagged as busy when processing a block data, preparing a key (ECB or CBC decryption only), or transferring a shared key from SAES peripheral. When GCM encryption is selected, this flag must be at zero before suspending current process to manage a higher-priority message.
0x420C0004 C   FIELD 07w01 KEYVALID (ro): Key valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the key of size defined by KEYSIZE is loaded in AES_KEYRx key registers. The EN bit can only be set when KEYVALID is set. In normal mode when KEYSEL[2:0] is at 000, the key must be written in the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag is set and KEYVALID remains cleared. When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, the BUSY flag is automatically set by AES. When the key is loaded successfully, BUSY is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, KEIF is set, BUSY cleared and KEYVALID remains cleared. If set, KEIF must be cleared through the AES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF flag description for more details. For further information on key loading, refer to Section23.4.18: AES key registers.
0x420C0008 B  REGISTER DINR: AES data input register
0x420C0008 C   FIELD 00w32 DIN (wo): Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the Input phase results in writing a complete 16-bytes block of input data to the AES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield, then written into the AES core 16-bytes input buffer. Reads return zero.
0x420C000C B  REGISTER DOUTR: AES data output register
0x420C000C C   FIELD 00w32 DOUT (ro): Output data word This read-only bitfield fetches a 32-bit output buffer. A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF flag set), virtually reads a complete 16-byte block of output data from the AES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0].
0x420C0010 B  REGISTER KEYR0: AES key register 0
0x420C0010 C   FIELD 00w32 KEY (wo): Cryptographic key, bits [31:0] This write-only bitfield contains the bits [31:0] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode MODE[1:0] in AES_CR. The AES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the AES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the AES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the AES_SR register. Note that, if KMOD[1:0] is at 10 (shared key), the key is directly loaded from SAES peripheral to AES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set). When KEYVALID is set a write to this register clears KEYVALID if AES is disabled.

The above mechanism is valid only if DCAL = 0. If NBLW[4:0] bitfield is written while DCAL is set to 1, the NBLW[4:0] bitfield remains unchanged. In other words it is not possible to configure NBLW[4:0] and set DCAL at the same time. Reading NBLW[4:0] bitfield returns the last value written to NBLW[4:0].
0x420C0408 C   FIELD 08w01 DCAL (rw): Digest calculation Writing this bit to 1 starts the message padding, using the previously written value of NBLW[4:0], and starts the calculation of the final message digest with all data words written to the input FIFO since the INIT bit was last written to 1. Reading this bit returns 0.

0x420C0424 C   FIELD 09w05 NBWP (ro): Number of words already pushed This bitfield is the exact number of words in the message that have already been pushed into the FIFO. NBWP is incremented by one when a write access is performed to the HASH_DIN register. When a digest calculation starts, NBWP is updated to NBWP- block size (in words), and NBWP goes to zero when the INIT bit is written to 1.
0x420C0424 C   FIELD 15w01 DINNE (ro): DIN not empty This bit is set when the HASH_DIN register holds valid data (that is after being written at least once). It is cleared when either the INIT bit (initialization) or the DCAL bit (completion of the previous message processing) is written to 1.

0x420C0C00 B  REGISTER CR: SAES control register
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 00w01 EN (rw): Enable This bit enables/disables the SAES peripheral. At any moment, clearing then setting the bit re-initializes the SAES peripheral. When KMOD[1:0] is different from 00, using IPRST bit is recommended instead. This bit is automatically cleared by hardware upon the completion of the key preparation (MODE[1:0] at 01) and upon the completion of GCM/GMAC/CCM initialization phase. The bit cannot be set as long as KEYVALID=0. The situation is similar for one of the following configurations: 1. KMOD[1:0] at 01 (wrap), CHMOD[2:0] at 11 (GCM) 2. KMOD[1:0] at 01 (wrap), CHMOD[2:0] at 10 (CTR), MODE[1:0] at 00 (encryption).
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 01w02 DATATYPE (rw): Data type This bitfield defines the format of data written in the SAES_DINR register or read from the SAES_DOUTR register, through selecting the mode of data swapping. This swapping is defined in Section23.4.17: SAES data registers and data swapping. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 03w02 MODE (rw): Operating mode This bitfield selects the SAES operating mode: Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.

0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 11w01 DMAINEN (rw): DMA input enable When this bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by the peripheral during the input data phase. Setting this bit is ignored when MODE[1:0] is at 01 (key derivation).
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 12w01 DMAOUTEN (rw): DMA output enable When this bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by the peripheral during the output data phase. Setting this bit is ignored when MODE[1:0] is at 01 (key derivation).
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 13w02 GCMPH (rw): GCM or CCM phase selection This bitfield selects the phase, applicable only with GCM, GMAC or CCM chaining modes. This bitfield has no effect if GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithm is not selected with CHMOD[2:0].

0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 18w01 KEYSIZE (rw): Key size selection This bitfield defines the key length in bits of the key used by SAES. When KMOD[1:0] is at 01 or 10, KEYSIZE also defines the length of the key to encrypt or decrypt. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when the EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 19w01 KEYPROT (rw): Key protection When set, hardware-based key protection is enabled. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 20w04 NPBLB (rw): Number of padding bytes in last block This padding information must be filled by software before processing the last block of GCM payload encryption or CCM payload decryption, otherwise authentication tag computation is incorrect. ...
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 24w02 KMOD (rw): Key mode selection The bitfield defines how the SAES key can be used by the application. KEYSIZE must be correctly initialized when setting KMOD[1:0] different from zero. Others: Reserved With KMOD[1:0] other than zero, any attempt to configure the SAES peripheral for use by an application belonging to a different security domain (such as secure or non-secure) results in automatic key erasure and setting of the KEIF flag. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 26w02 KSHAREID (rw): Key share identification This bitfield defines, at the end of a decryption process with KMOD[1:0] at 10 (shared key), which target can read the SAES key registers using a dedicated hardware bus. Others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 28w03 KEYSEL (rw): Key selection The bitfield defines the source of the key information to use in the AES cryptographic core. Others: Reserved (if used, unfreeze SAES with IPRST) When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, selected key value is available in key registers when BUSY bit is cleared and KEYVALID is set in the SAES_SR register. Otherwise, the key error flag KEIF is set. Repeated writing of KEYSEL[2:0] with the same non-zero value only triggers the loading of DHUK or BHK when KEYVALIDis cleared. When the application software changes the key selection by writing the KEYSEL[2:0] bitfield, the key registers are immediately erased and the KEYVALID flag cleared. At the end of the decryption process, if KMOD[1:0] is other than zero, KEYSEL[2:0] is cleared. With the bitfield value other than zero and KEYVALID set, the application cannot transfer the ownership of SAES with a loaded key to an application running in another security context (such as secure, non-secure). More specifically, when security of an access to any register does not match the information recorded by SAES, the KEIF flag is set. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x420C0C00 C   FIELD 31w01 IPRST (rw): SAES peripheral software reset Setting the bit resets the SAES peripheral, putting all registers to their default values, except the IPRST bit itself. Hence, any key-relative data are lost. For this reason, it is recommended to set the bit before handing over the SAES to a less secure application. The bit must be low while writing any configuration registers.
0x420C0C04 B  REGISTER SR: SAES status register
0x420C0C04 C   FIELD 01w01 RDERRF (ro): Read error flag This bit is set when an unexpected read to the SAES_DOUTR register occurred. When set RDERRF bit has no impact on the SAES operations. This flag is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit in SAES_ICR register. If RWEIE bit is set in SAES_IER register an interrupt is generated when RDERRF is set. It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register.
0x420C0C04 C   FIELD 02w01 WRERRF (ro): Write error flag This bit is set when an unexpected write to the SAES_DINR register occurred. When set WRERRF bit has no impact on the SAES operations. This flag is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit in SAES_ICR register. If RWEIE bit is set in SAES_IER register an interrupt is generated when WRERRF is set. It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register.
0x420C0C04 C   FIELD 03w01 BUSY (ro): Busy This flag indicates whether SAES is idle or busy. SAES is flagged as idle when disabled or when the last processing is completed. SAES is flagged as busy when processing a block data, preparing a key (ECB or CBC decryption only), fetching random number from the RNG, or transferring a shared key to target peripheral. When GCM encryption is selected, this flag must be at zero before suspending current process to manage a higher-priority message. BUSY must also be cleared before selecting the GCM final phase.
0x420C0C04 C   FIELD 07w01 KEYVALID (ro): Key valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the key of size defined by KEYSIZE is loaded in SAES_KEYRx key registers. The EN bit can only be set when KEYVALID is set. In normal mode when KEYSEL[2:0] is at 000, the key must be written in the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag is set and KEYVALID remains cleared. When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, the BUSY flag is automatically set by SAES. When the key is loaded successfully, BUSY is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, KEIF is set, BUSY cleared and KEYVALID remains cleared. If set, KEIF must be cleared through the SAES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF flag description for more details. For further information on key loading, refer to Section23.4.18: SAES key registers.
0x420C0C08 B  REGISTER DINR: SAES data input register
0x420C0C08 C   FIELD 00w32 DIN (wo): Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the Input phase results in writing a complete 16-bytes block of input data to the SAES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield, then written into the AES core 16-bytes input buffer. Reads return zero.
0x420C0C0C B  REGISTER DOUTR: SAES data output register
0x420C0C0C C   FIELD 00w32 DOUT (ro): Output data word This read-only bitfield fetches a 32-bit output buffer. A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF flag set), virtually reads a complete 16-byte block of output data from the SAES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0].
0x420C0C10 B  REGISTER KEYR0: SAES key register 0
0x420C0C10 C   FIELD 00w32 KEY (wo): Cryptographic key, bits [31:0] This write-only bitfield contains the bits [31:0] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode MODE[1:0] in SAES_CR. The SAES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the SAES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the SAES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the SAES_SR register. Note that, if KEYSEL[2:0] is different from 0 and KEYVALID=0, the key is directly loaded to SAES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set).

This flags has no meaning when key derivation mode is selected.
0x420C0F04 C   FIELD 02w01 KEIF (ro): Key error interrupt flag This read-only bit is set by hardware when key information failed to load into key registers or key register usage is forbidden. Setting the corresponding bit of the SAES_ICR register clears the KEIF and generates interrupt if the KEIE bit of the SAES_IER register is set. KEIF is triggered upon any of the following errors: SAES fails to load the DHUK (KEYSEL[2:0]=001 or 100). SAES fails to load the BHK (KEYSEL[2:0]=010 or 100) respecting the correct order. AES fails to load the key shared by SAES peripheral (KMOD=10). When KEYVALID is set and either KEYPROT is set or KEYSEL[2:0] is other than 000, the security context of the application that loads the key (secure or non-secure) does not match the security attribute of the access to SAES_CR or SAES_DOUT. In this case, KEYVALID and EN bits are cleared. SAES_KEYRx register write does not respect the correct order. (For KEYSIZE=0, SAES_KEYR0 then SAES_KEYR1 then SAES_KEYR2 then SAES_KEYR3 register, or reverse. For KEYSIZE set, SAES_KEYR0 then SAES_KEYR1 then SAES_KEYR2 then SAES_KEYR3 then SAES_KEYR4 then SAES_KEYR5 then SAES_KEYR6 then SAES_KEYR7, or reverse). KEIF must be cleared by the application software, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set.
0x420C0F04 C   FIELD 03w01 RNGEIF (ro): RNG error interrupt flag This read-only bit is set by hardware when an error is detected on RNG bus interface (e.g. bad entropy). RNGEIE bit is cleared when application sets the corresponding bit of SAES_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if the RNGEIE bit has been previously set in the SAES_IER register. Clearing this bit triggers the reload of a new random number from RNG peripheral.

0x46002000 B  REGISTER CR1: SPI control register 1
0x46002000 C   FIELD 00w01 SPE (rw): serial peripheral enable This bit is set by and cleared by software. When SPE = 1, SPI data transfer is enabled, SPI_CFG1 and SPI_CFG2 configuration registers, CRCPOLY, UDRDR, part of SPI_AUTOCR register and IOLOCK bit in the SPI_CR1 register are write protected. They can be changed only when SPE = 0. When SPE = 0 any SPI operation is stopped and disabled, all the pending requests of the events with enabled interrupt are blocked except the MODF interrupt request (but their pending still propagates the request of the spi_plck clock), the SS output is deactivated at master, the RDY signal keeps not ready status at slave, the internal state machine is reseted, all the FIFOs content is flushed, CRC calculation initialized, receive data register is read zero. SPE is cleared and cannot be set when MODF error flag is active.
0x46002000 C   FIELD 08w01 MASRX (rw): master automatic suspension in Receive mode This bit is set and cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition. When SPI communication is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay. This is why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared, the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent any subsequent suspension.
0x46002000 C   FIELD 09w01 CSTART (rw): master transfer start This bit can be set by software if SPI is enabled only to start an SPI communication. it is cleared by hardware when end of transfer (EOT) flag is set or when a transaction suspend request is accepted. In SPI mode, the bit is taken into account at master mode only. If transmission is enabled, communication starts or continues only if any data is available in the transmission FIFO.
0x46002000 C   FIELD 10w01 CSUSP (wo): master suspend request This bit reads as zero. In Master mode, when this bit is set by software, the CSTART bit is reset at the end of the current frame and communication is suspended. The user has to check SUSP flag to check end of the frame transaction. The Master mode communication must be suspended (using this bit or keeping TXDR empty) before going to Low-power mode. Can be used in SPI or I2S mode. After software suspension, SUSP flag must be cleared and SPI disabled and re-enabled before the next transaction starts.

It monitors overall space currently available at TxFIFO no matter if SPI is enabled or not. It must be checked once a complete data packet is stored at TxFIFO.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 02w01 DXP (ro): duplex packet DXP flag is set whenever both TXP and RXP flags are set regardless SPI mode.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 03w01 EOT (ro): end of transfer EOT is set by hardware as soon as a full transfer is complete, that is when SPI is re-enabled or when TSIZE number of data have been transmitted and/or received on the SPI. EOT is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to EOTC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. EOT flag triggers an interrupt if EOTIE bit is set. If DXP flag is used until TXTF flag is set and DXPIE is cleared, EOT can be used to download the last packets contained into RxFIFO in one-shot. In master, EOT event terminates the data transaction and handles SS output optionally. When CRC is applied, the EOT event is extended over the CRC frame transaction. To restart the internal state machine properly, SPI is strongly suggested to be disabled and re-enabled before next transaction starts despite its setting is not changed.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 04w01 TXTF (ro): transmission transfer filled TXTF is set by hardware as soon as all of the data packets in a transfer have been submitted for transmission by application software or DMA, that is when TSIZE number of data have been pushed into the TxFIFO. This bit is cleared by software write 1 to TXTFC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively. TXTF flag triggers an interrupt if TXTFIE bit is set. TXTF setting clears the TXPIE and DXPIE masks so to off-load application software from calculating when to disable TXP and DXP interrupts.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 05w01 UDR (ro): underrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to UDRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. Note: In SPI mode, the UDR flag applies to Slave mode only. In I2S/PCM mode, (when available) this flag applies to Master and Slave mode
0x46002014 C   FIELD 06w01 OVR (ro): overrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to OVRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally.

0x46002014 C   FIELD 11w01 SUSP (ro): suspension status In Master mode, SUSP is set by hardware either as soon as the current frame is completed after CSUSP request is done or at master automatic suspend receive mode (MASRX bit is set at SPI_CR1 register) on RxFIFO full condition. SUSP generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set. This bit must be cleared prior SPI is disabled and this is done by writing 1 to SUSPC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 12w01 TXC (ro): TxFIFO transmission complete The flag behavior depends on TSIZE setting. When TSIZE = 0 the TXC is changed by hardware exclusively and it raises each time the TxFIFO becomes empty and there is no activity on the bus. If TSIZE different 0 there is no specific reason to monitor TXC as it just copies the EOT flag value including its software clearing. The TXC generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 13w02 RXPLVL (ro): RxFIFO packing level When RXWNE = 0 and data size is set up to 16-bit, the value gives number of remaining data frames persisting at RxFIFO. Note: (*): Optional value when data size is set up to 8-bit only. When data size is greater than 16-bit, these bits are always read as 00. In that consequence, the single data frame received at the FIFO cannot be detected neither by RWNE nor by RXPLVL bits if data size is set from 17 to 24 bits. The user then must apply other methods like TSIZE 0 or FTHLV = 0.
0x46002014 C   FIELD 15w01 RXWNE (ro): RxFIFO word not empty Note: This bit value does not depend on DSIZE setting and keeps together with RXPLVL[1:0] information about RxFIFO occupancy by residual data.

0x46002020 C   FIELD 00w32 TXDR (wo): transmit data register The register serves as an interface with TxFIFO. A write to it accesses TxFIFO. Note: data is always right-aligned. Unused bits are ignored when writing to the register, and read as zero when the register is read. Note: DR can be accessed byte-wise (8-bit access): in this case only one data-byte is written by single access. Note: halfword-wise (16 bit access) in this case 2 data-bytes or 1 halfword-data can be written by single access. Note: word-wise (32 bit access). In this case 4 data-bytes or 2 halfword-data or word-data can be written by single access. Note: Write access of this register less than the configured data size is forbidden.

0x46002040 B  REGISTER CRCPOLY: SPI polynomial register
0x46002040 C   FIELD 00w32 CRCPOLY (rw): CRC polynomial register This register contains the polynomial for the CRC calculation. The default 9-bit polynomial setting 0x107 corresponds to default 8-bit setting of DSIZE. It is compatible with setting 0x07 used in other ST products with fixed length of the polynomial string, where the most significant bit of the string is always kept hidden. Length of the polynomial is given by the most significant bit of the value stored in this register. It must be set greater than DSIZE. CRC33_17 bit must be set additionally with CRCPOLY register when DSIZE is configured to maximum 32-bit or 16-bit size and CRC is enabled (to keep polynomial length grater than data size). Note: CRCPOLY[31:16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

0x46002044 C   FIELD 00w32 TXCRC (ro): CRC register for transmitter When CRC calculation is enabled, the TXCRC[31:0] bits contain the computed CRC value of the subsequently transmitted bytes. CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: TXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored. Note: The configuration of CRCSIZE bit field is not taken into account when the content of this register is read by software. No masking is applied for unused bits in this case.
0x46002048 B  REGISTER RXCRC: SPI receiver CRC register
0x46002048 C   FIELD 00w32 RXCRC (ro): CRC register for receiver When CRC calculation is enabled, the RXCRC[31:0] bits contain the computed CRC value of the subsequently received bytes. CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: RXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

The number of bits considered depends on DSIZE bit settings of the SPI_CFG1 register. Underrun condition handling depends on setting UDRCFG bit at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: UDRDR[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constraint when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

0x46002400 B  REGISTER CR1 (rw): LPUART control register 1
0x46002400 C   FIELD 00w01 UE (rw): LPUART enable When this bit is cleared, the LPUART prescalers and outputs are stopped immediately, and current operations are discarded. The configuration of the LPUART is kept, but all the status flags, in the LPUART_ISR are reset. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: To enter low-power mode without generating errors on the line, the TE bit must be reset before and the software must wait for the TC bit in the LPUART_ISR to be set before resetting the UE bit. Note: The DMA requests are also reset when UE = 0 so the DMA channel must be disabled before resetting the UE bit.
0x46002400 C   FIELD 01w01 UESM (rw): LPUART enable in low-power mode When this bit is cleared, the LPUART cannot request its kernel clock and is not functional in low-power mode.

When the Autonomous mode is used, TE bit becomes a status bit, which is set and cleared by hardware. Note: During transmission, a low pulse on the TE bit (0 followed by 1) sends a preamble (idle line) after the current word, except in Smartcard mode. In order to generate an idle character, the TE must not be immediately written to 1. To ensure the required duration, the software can poll the TEACK bit in the USART_ISR register. Note: In Smartcard mode, when TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.

When the parity control is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB position (9th bit if M=1; 8th bit if M=0) and parity is checked on the received data. This bit is set and cleared by software. Once it is set, PCE is active after the current byte (in reception and in transmission). This bitfield can only be written when the LPUART is disabled (UE=0).

For more details, refer Section 79.4.14: RS232 Hardware flow control and RS485 Driver Enable. If the LPUART_TDR register is written during the DEDT time, the new data is transmitted only when the DEDT and DEAT times have both elapsed. This bitfield can only be written when the LPUART is disabled (UE=0).
0x46002400 C   FIELD 21w05 DEAT (rw): Driver Enable assertion time This 5-bit value defines the time between the activation of the DE (Driver Enable) signal and the beginning of the start bit.

The MSB of the character sent by the transmitter should be equal to 1. In 4-bit address mark detection, only ADD[3:0] bits are used. In low-power mode: they are used for wake up from low-power mode on character match. When a character, received during low-power mode, corresponds to the character programmed through ADD[7:0] bitfield, the CMF flag is set and wakes up the device from low-power mode if the corresponding interrupt is enabled by setting CMIE bit. In Run mode with Mute mode inactive (for example, end-of-block detection in ModBus protocol): the whole received character (8 bits) is compared to ADD[7:0] value and CMF flag is set on match. An interrupt is generated if the CMIE bit is set. These bits can only be written when the reception is disabled (RE = 0) or when the USART is disabled (UE = 0).

0x46002418 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: If the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x46002418 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the LPUART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x46002418 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit clears the RXNE flag. This enables discarding the received data without reading it, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x46002418 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request This bit is used when FIFO mode is enabled. TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the flag TXFE (TXFIFO empty, bit 23 in the LPUART_ISR register). Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.

0x4600241C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE = 1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the LPUART_RDR.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Start bit noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on the start bit of a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This error is associated with the character in the LPUART_RDR.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the LPUART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the LPUART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the LPUART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the LPUART_CR3 register.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the LPUART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, and so data can be read from the LPUART_RDR register. Every read of the LPUART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. It is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the LPUART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the LPUART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the LPUART_ICR register or by writing to the LPUART_TDR register.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full, and so data can be written in the LPUART_TDR. Every write in the LPUART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the LPUART_TDR. The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time). An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the CTSCF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CTSIE=1 in the LPUART_CR3 register. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the CTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.

0x4600241C C   FIELD 17w01 CMF (ro): Character match flag This bit is set by hardware, when a the character defined by ADD[7:0] is received. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the CMCF in the LPUART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CMIE=1in the LPUART_CR1 register.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 18w01 SBKF (ro): Send break flag This bit indicates that a send break character was requested. It is set by software, by writing 1 to the SBKRQ bit in the LPUART_CR3 register. It is automatically reset by hardware during the stop bit of break transmission.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the LPUART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the LPUART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the LPUART_RQR register. Note: If the LPUART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the LPUART. It can be used when an idle frame request is generated by writing TE=0, followed by TE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register, in order to respect the TE=0 minimum period.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the LPUART. It can be used to verify that the LPUART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the LPUART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x4600241C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO Empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is Empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared.

This decreases the frequency of the calendar with a resolution of 0.9537ppm. To increase the frequency of the calendar, this feature should be used in conjunction with CALP. See Section74.3.16: RTC smooth digital calibration on page4278.

0x4600782C C   FIELD 00w15 SUBFS (wo): Subtract a fraction of a second These bits are write only and is always read as zero. Writing to this bit has no effect when a shift operation is pending (when SHPF = 1, in RTC_ICSR). The value which is written to SUBFS is added to the synchronous prescaler counter. Since this counter counts down, this operation effectively subtracts from (delays) the clock by: Delay (seconds) = SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1) A fraction of a second can effectively be added to the clock (advancing the clock) when the ADD1S function is used in conjunction with SUBFS, effectively advancing the clock by: Advance (seconds) = (1 - (SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1))). In mixed BCD-binary mode (BIN=10 or 11), the SUBFS[14:BCDU+8] must be written with 0. Note: Writing to SUBFS causes RSF to be cleared. Software can then wait until RSF = 1 to be sure that the shadow registers have been updated with the shifted time.

Note: The gated mode must not be used if tim_ti1f_ed is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, tim_ti1f_ed outputs 1 pulse for each transition on tim_ti1f, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, tim_trgi must not be connected to tim_etrf in this case (TS bits must not be 00111). Note: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is tim_etrf.

0x500003DC C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

Note: The gated mode must not be used if tim_ti1f_ed is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, tim_ti1f_ed outputs 1 pulse for each transition on tim_ti1f, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

Nevertheless, tim_trgi must not be connected to tim_etrf in this case (TS bits must not be 00111).

0x500007DC C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

It is reset by hardware when the reload value update operation is completed in the VsubDD/sub voltage domain (takes up to three periods of the IWDG kernel clock iwdg_ker_ck). The window value can be updated only when WVU bit is reset. This bit is generated only if generic 'window' = 1
0x5000300C C   FIELD 03w01 EWU (ro): Watchdog interrupt comparator value update This bit is set by hardware to indicate that an update of the interrupt comparator value (EWIT[11:0]) or an update of the EWIE is ongoing. It is reset by hardware when the update operation is completed in the VsubDD/sub voltage domain (takes up to three periods of the IWDG kernel clock iwdg_ker_ck). The EWIT[11:0] and EWIE fields can be updated only when EWU bit is reset.
0x5000300C C   FIELD 08w01 ONF (ro): Watchdog enable status bit Set to '1' by hardware as soon as the IWDG is started, remains to '1' until the IWDG is reset.
0x5000300C C   FIELD 14w01 EWIF (ro): Watchdog early interrupt flag This bit is set to '1' by hardware in order to indicate that an early interrupt is pending. This bit must be cleared by the software by writing the bit EWIC of IWDG_EWCR register to '1'.
0x50003010 B  REGISTER WINR: IWDG window register
0x50003010 C   FIELD 00w12 WIN (rw): Watchdog counter window value These bits are write access protected, see Section 29.4.6, they contain the high limit of the window value to be compared with the downcounter. To prevent a reset, the IWDCNT downcounter must be reloaded when its value is lower than WIN[11:0]+1 and greater than 1. The WVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the reload value from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing. For this reason the value read from this register is valid only when the WVU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.
0x50003014 B  REGISTER EWCR: IWDG early wakeup interrupt register
0x50003014 C   FIELD 00w12 EWIT (rw): Watchdog counter window value These bits are write access protected (see Section 29.4.6). They are written by software to define at which position of the IWDCNT down-counter the early wakeup interrupt must be generated. The early interrupt is generated when the IWDCNT is lower or equal to EWIT[11:0] - 1. EWIT[11:0] must be bigger than 1. An interrupt is generated only if EWIE = 1. The EWU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the Early wakeup comparator value and the Interrupt enable bit from the VsubDD/sub voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing, hence the value read from this register is valid only when the EWU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) is reset.
0x50003014 C   FIELD 14w01 EWIC (wo): Watchdog early interrupt acknowledge The software must write a 1 into this bit in order to acknowledge the early wakeup interrupt and to clear the EWIF flag. Writing 0 has not effect, reading this flag returns a 0.
0x50003014 C   FIELD 15w01 EWIE (rw): Watchdog early interrupt enable Set and reset by software. The EWU bit in the IWDG status register (IWDG_SR) must be reset to be able to change the value of this bit.

The USART configuration is kept, but all the USART_ISR status flags are reset. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: To enter low-power mode without generating errors on the line, the TE bit must be previously reset and the software must wait for the TC bit in the USART_ISR to be set before resetting the UE bit. Note: The DMA requests are also reset when UE = 0 so the DMA channel must be disabled before resetting the UE bit. Note: In Smartcard mode, (SCEN = 1), the CK is always available when CLKEN = 1, regardless of the UE bit value.

When the Autonomous mode is used, TE bit becomes a status bit, which is set and cleared by hardware. Note: During transmission, a low pulse on the TE bit (0 followed by 1) sends a preamble (idle line) after the current word, except in Smartcard mode. In order to generate an idle character, the TE must not be immediately written to 1. To ensure the required duration, the software can poll the TEACK bit in the USART_ISR register. Note: In Smartcard mode, when TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.

In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
0x50004414 C   FIELD 24w08 BLEN (rw): Block Length This bitfield gives the Block length in Smartcard T=1 Reception. Its value equals the number of information characters + the length of the Epilogue Field (1-LEC/2-CRC) - 1. Examples: BLEN = 0 - 0 information characters + LEC BLEN = 1 - 0 information characters + CRC BLEN = 255 - 254 information characters + CRC (total 256 characters)) In Smartcard mode, the Block length counter is reset when TXE=0 (TXFE = 0 in case FIFO mode is enabled). This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE=0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.
0x50004418 B  REGISTER RQR (wo): USART request register
0x50004418 C   FIELD 00w01 ABRRQ (wo): Auto baud rate request Writing 1 to this bit resets the ABRF and ABRE flags in the USART_ISR and requests an automatic baud rate measurement on the next received data frame. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x50004418 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x50004418 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x50004418 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x50004418 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.
0x5000441C B  REGISTER ISR (ro): USART interrupt and status register [alternate]
0x5000441C C   FIELD 00w01 PE (ro): Parity error This bit is set by hardware when a parity error occurs in Reception mode. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the PECF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if PEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Section 78.5.9: Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page 4584). Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the USART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the USART_CR3 register.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle Line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXE/TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by writing to the USART_TDR register.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full meaning that data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write operation to the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE is set at the same time). Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR. An interrupt is generated if LBDIE = 1 in the USART_CR2 register. Note: If the USART does not support LIN mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the CTSCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CTSIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the CTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 11w01 RTOF (ro): Receiver timeout This bit is set by hardware when the timeout value, programmed in the RTOR register has lapsed, without any communication. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. Note: The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. Note: If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 12w01 EOBF (ro): End of block flag This bit is set by hardware when a complete block has been received (for example T=1 Smartcard mode). The detection is done when the number of received bytes (from the start of the block, including the prologue) is equal or greater than BLEN + 4. An interrupt is generated if EOBIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to EOBCF in the USART_ICR register. Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 13w01 UDR (ro): SPI slave underrun error flag In Slave transmission mode, this flag is set when the first clock pulse for data transmission appears while the software has not yet loaded any value into USART_TDR. This flag is reset by setting UDRCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: If the USART does not support the SPI slave mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 14w01 ABRE (ro): Auto baud rate error This bit is set by hardware if the baud rate measurement failed (baud rate out of range or character comparison failed) It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 15w01 ABRF (ro): Auto baud rate flag This bit is set by hardware when the automatic baud rate has been set (RXFNE is also set, generating an interrupt if RXFNEIE = 1) or when the auto baud rate operation was completed without success (ABRE=1) (ABRE, RXFNE and FE are also set in this case) It is cleared by software, in order to request a new auto baud rate detection, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 16w01 BUSY (ro): Busy flag This bit is set and reset by hardware. It is active when a communication is ongoing on the RX line (successful start bit detected). It is reset at the end of the reception (successful or not).

0x5000441C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the USART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used when an idle frame request is generated by writing TE=0, followed by TE=1 in the USART_CR1 register, in order to respect the TE=0 minimum period.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used to verify that the USART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO Empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is Empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared. The TXFE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the bit TXFRQ (bit 4) in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if the TXFEIE bit =1 (bit 30) in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 24w01 RXFF (ro): RXFIFO Full This bit is set by hardware when the number of received data corresponds to RXFIFO size + 1 (RXFIFO full + 1 data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 25w01 TCBGT (ro): Transmission complete before guard time flag This bit is set when the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted correctly out of the shift register. It is set by hardware in Smartcard mode, if the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and if the smartcard did not send back any NACK. An interrupt is generated if TCBGTIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. This bit is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCBGTCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If the USART does not support the Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. If the USART supports the Smartcard mode and the Smartcard mode is enabled, the TCBGT reset value is 1. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 26w01 RXFT (ro): RXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the threshold programmed in RXFTCFG in USART_CR3 register is reached. This means that there are (RXFTCFG - 1) data in the Receive FIFO and one data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFTIE bit =1 (bit 27) in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When the RXFTCFG threshold is configured to 101, RXFT flag is set if 16 data are available i.e. 15 data in the RXFIFO and 1 data in the USART_RDR. Consequently, the 17th received data does not cause an overrun error. The overrun error occurs after receiving the 18th data.
0x5000441C C   FIELD 27w01 TXFT (ro): TXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the TXFIFO reaches the threshold programmed in TXFTCFG of USART_CR3 register i.e. the TXFIFO contains TXFTCFG empty locations.

Note: The gated mode must not be used if tim_ti1f_ed is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, tim_ti1f_ed outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

0x50012FDC C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x50012FDC C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

0x50013000 B  REGISTER CR1: SPI control register 1
0x50013000 C   FIELD 00w01 SPE (rw): serial peripheral enable This bit is set by and cleared by software. When SPE = 1, SPI data transfer is enabled, SPI_CFG1 and SPI_CFG2 configuration registers, CRCPOLY, UDRDR, part of SPI_AUTOCR register and IOLOCK bit in the SPI_CR1 register are write protected. They can be changed only when SPE = 0. When SPE = 0 any SPI operation is stopped and disabled, all the pending requests of the events with enabled interrupt are blocked except the MODF interrupt request (but their pending still propagates the request of the spi_plck clock), the SS output is deactivated at master, the RDY signal keeps not ready status at slave, the internal state machine is reseted, all the FIFOs content is flushed, CRC calculation initialized, receive data register is read zero. SPE is cleared and cannot be set when MODF error flag is active.
0x50013000 C   FIELD 08w01 MASRX (rw): master automatic suspension in Receive mode This bit is set and cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition. When SPI communication is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay. This is why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared, the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent any subsequent suspension.
0x50013000 C   FIELD 09w01 CSTART (rw): master transfer start This bit can be set by software if SPI is enabled only to start an SPI communication. it is cleared by hardware when end of transfer (EOT) flag is set or when a transaction suspend request is accepted.

0x50013000 C   FIELD 10w01 CSUSP (wo): master suspend request This bit reads as zero. In Master mode, when this bit is set by software, the CSTART bit is reset at the end of the current frame and communication is suspended. The user has to check SUSP flag to check end of the frame transaction. The Master mode communication must be suspended (using this bit or keeping TXDR empty) before going to Low-power mode. Can be used in SPI or I2S mode. After software suspension, SUSP flag must be cleared and SPI disabled and re-enabled before the next transaction starts.

It monitors overall space currently available at TxFIFO no matter if SPI is enabled or not. It must be checked once a complete data packet is stored at TxFIFO.
0x50013014 C   FIELD 02w01 DXP (ro): duplex packet DXP flag is set whenever both TXP and RXP flags are set regardless SPI mode.
0x50013014 C   FIELD 03w01 EOT (ro): end of transfer EOT is set by hardware as soon as a full transfer is complete, that is when SPI is re-enabled or when TSIZE number of data have been transmitted and/or received on the SPI. EOT is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to EOTC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. EOT flag triggers an interrupt if EOTIE bit is set. If DXP flag is used until TXTF flag is set and DXPIE is cleared, EOT can be used to download the last packets contained into RxFIFO in one-shot. In master, EOT event terminates the data transaction and handles SS output optionally. When CRC is applied, the EOT event is extended over the CRC frame transaction. To restart the internal state machine properly, SPI is strongly suggested to be disabled and re-enabled before next transaction starts despite its setting is not changed.

0x50013014 C   FIELD 12w01 TXC (ro): TxFIFO transmission complete The flag behavior depends on TSIZE setting. When TSIZE = 0 the TXC is changed by hardware exclusively and it raises each time the TxFIFO becomes empty and there is no activity on the bus. If TSIZE different 0 there is no specific reason to monitor TXC as it just copies the EOT flag value including its software clearing. The TXC generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set.

Note: (*): Optional value when data size is set up to 8-bit only. When data size is greater than 16-bit, these bits are always read as 00. In that consequence, the single data frame received at the FIFO cannot be detected neither by RWNE nor by RXPLVL bits if data size is set from 17 to 24 bits. The user then must apply other methods like TSIZE 0 or FTHLV = 0.
0x50013014 C   FIELD 15w01 RXWNE (ro): RxFIFO word not empty Note: This bit value does not depend on DSIZE setting and keeps together with RXPLVL[1:0] information about RxFIFO occupancy by residual data.

CRC33_17 bit must be set additionally with CRCPOLY register when DSIZE is configured to maximum 32-bit or 16-bit size and CRC is enabled (to keep polynomial length grater than data size). Note: CRCPOLY[31:16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses.

In Reception mode, it specifies the number or erroneous reception trials, before generating a reception error (RXNE/RXFNE and PE bits set). This bitfield must be programmed only when the USART is disabled (UE=0). When the USART is enabled (UE=1), this bitfield may only be written to 0x0, in order to stop retransmission. 0x1 to 0x7: number of automatic retransmission attempts (before signaling error) Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.

PSC[4:0]: Prescaler value This bitfield is used for programming the prescaler for dividing the USART source clock to provide the Smartcard clock. The value given in the register (5 significant bits) is multiplied by 2 to give the division factor of the source clock frequency: ... This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: Bits [7:5] must be kept cleared if Smartcard mode is used. Note: This bitfield is reserved and forced by hardware to 0 when the Smartcard and IrDA modes are not supported. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x50013810 C   FIELD 08w08 GT (rw): Guard time value This bitfield is used to program the Guard time value in terms of number of baud clock periods. This is used in Smartcard mode. The Transmission Complete flag is set after this guard time value. This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0). Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x50013814 B  REGISTER RTOR (rw): USART receiver timeout register
0x50013814 C   FIELD 00w24 RTO (rw): Receiver timeout value This bitfield gives the Receiver timeout value in terms of number of bit duration. In Standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
0x50013814 C   FIELD 24w08 BLEN (rw): Block Length This bitfield gives the Block length in Smartcard T=1 Reception. Its value equals the number of information characters + the length of the Epilogue Field (1-LEC/2-CRC) - 1. Examples: BLEN = 0 - 0 information characters + LEC BLEN = 1 - 0 information characters + CRC BLEN = 255 - 254 information characters + CRC (total 256 characters)) In Smartcard mode, the Block length counter is reset when TXE=0 (TXFE = 0 in case FIFO mode is enabled). This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE=0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.
0x50013818 B  REGISTER RQR (wo): USART request register
0x50013818 C   FIELD 00w01 ABRRQ (wo): Auto baud rate request Writing 1 to this bit resets the ABRF and ABRE flags in the USART_ISR and requests an automatic baud rate measurement on the next received data frame. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x50013818 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x50013818 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x50013818 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x50013818 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.
0x5001381C B  REGISTER ISR (ro): USART interrupt and status register [alternate]
0x5001381C C   FIELD 00w01 PE (ro): Parity error This bit is set by hardware when a parity error occurs in Reception mode. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the PECF in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if PEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 01w01 FE (ro): Framing error This bit is set by hardware when a de-synchronization, excessive noise or a break character is detected. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame). An interrupt is generated if EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Section 78.5.9: Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page 4584). Note: This error is associated with the character in the USART_RDR.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the USART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This bit is permanently forced to 0 (no overrun detection) when the bit OVRDIS is set in the USART_CR3 register.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 04w01 IDLE (ro): Idle line detected This bit is set by hardware when an Idle Line is detected. An interrupt is generated if IDLEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXE/TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by writing to the USART_TDR register.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full meaning that data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write operation to the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE is set at the same time). Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 08w01 LBDF (ro): LIN break detection flag This bit is set by hardware when the LIN break is detected. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the LBDCF in the USART_ICR. An interrupt is generated if LBDIE = 1 in the USART_CR2 register. Note: If the USART does not support LIN mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set. It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the CTSCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if CTSIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 10w01 CTS (ro): CTS flag This bit is set/reset by hardware. It is an inverted copy of the status of the CTS input pin. Note: If the hardware flow control feature is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 11w01 RTOF (ro): Receiver timeout This bit is set by hardware when the timeout value, programmed in the RTOR register has lapsed, without any communication. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE=1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. Note: The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1. If the timeout has already elapsed when RE is set, then RTOF is set. Note: If the USART does not support the Receiver timeout feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 12w01 EOBF (ro): End of block flag This bit is set by hardware when a complete block has been received (for example T=1 Smartcard mode). The detection is done when the number of received bytes (from the start of the block, including the prologue) is equal or greater than BLEN + 4. An interrupt is generated if EOBIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to EOBCF in the USART_ICR register. Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 13w01 UDR (ro): SPI slave underrun error flag In Slave transmission mode, this flag is set when the first clock pulse for data transmission appears while the software has not yet loaded any value into USART_TDR. This flag is reset by setting UDRCF bit in the USART_ICR register. Note: If the USART does not support the SPI slave mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 14w01 ABRE (ro): Auto baud rate error This bit is set by hardware if the baud rate measurement failed (baud rate out of range or character comparison failed) It is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 15w01 ABRF (ro): Auto baud rate flag This bit is set by hardware when the automatic baud rate has been set (RXFNE is also set, generating an interrupt if RXFNEIE = 1) or when the auto baud rate operation was completed without success (ABRE=1) (ABRE, RXFNE and FE are also set in this case) It is cleared by software, in order to request a new auto baud rate detection, by writing 1 to the ABRRQ in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the auto baud rate feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 16w01 BUSY (ro): Busy flag This bit is set and reset by hardware. It is active when a communication is ongoing on the RX line (successful start bit detected). It is reset at the end of the reception (successful or not).

0x5001381C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the USART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the USART_RQR register. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used when an idle frame request is generated by writing TE=0, followed by TE=1 in the USART_CR1 register, in order to respect the TE=0 minimum period.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 22w01 REACK (ro): Receive enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Receive Enable value is taken into account by the USART. It can be used to verify that the USART is ready for reception before entering low-power mode. Note: If the USART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 23w01 TXFE (ro): TXFIFO Empty This bit is set by hardware when TXFIFO is Empty. When the TXFIFO contains at least one data, this flag is cleared. The TXFE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the bit TXFRQ (bit 4) in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if the TXFEIE bit =1 (bit 30) in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 24w01 RXFF (ro): RXFIFO Full This bit is set by hardware when the number of received data corresponds to RXFIFO size + 1 (RXFIFO full + 1 data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 25w01 TCBGT (ro): Transmission complete before guard time flag This bit is set when the last data written in the USART_TDR has been transmitted correctly out of the shift register. It is set by hardware in Smartcard mode, if the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and if the smartcard did not send back any NACK. An interrupt is generated if TCBGTIE=1 in the USART_CR3 register. This bit is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCBGTCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If the USART does not support the Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value. If the USART supports the Smartcard mode and the Smartcard mode is enabled, the TCBGT reset value is 1. Refer to Section 78.4: USART implementation on page 4565.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 26w01 RXFT (ro): RXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the threshold programmed in RXFTCFG in USART_CR3 register is reached. This means that there are (RXFTCFG - 1) data in the Receive FIFO and one data in the USART_RDR register. An interrupt is generated if the RXFTIE bit =1 (bit 27) in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When the RXFTCFG threshold is configured to 101, RXFT flag is set if 16 data are available i.e. 15 data in the RXFIFO and 1 data in the USART_RDR. Consequently, the 17th received data does not cause an overrun error. The overrun error occurs after receiving the 18th data.
0x5001381C C   FIELD 27w01 TXFT (ro): TXFIFO threshold flag This bit is set by hardware when the TXFIFO reaches the threshold programmed in TXFTCFG of USART_CR3 register i.e. the TXFIFO contains TXFTCFG empty locations.

The USART_TDR register provides the parallel interface between the internal bus and the output shift register (see Figure 927). When transmitting with the parity enabled (PCE bit set to 1 in the USART_CR1 register), the value written in the MSB (bit 7 or bit 8 depending on the data length) has no effect because it is replaced by the parity. Note: This register must be written only when TXE/TXFNF=1.

Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] =0 ), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLIsub1/sub.

Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer. Note: A non-null source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: When configured in packing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.PAM[1] = 1 and destination data width different from source data width), a non-null source block size must be a multiple of the destination data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0]).

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1. Note: A source address must be aligned with the programmed data width of a source burst (SA[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1.

Otherwise a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued.

0x50020190 C   FIELD 20w06 DBL_1 (rw): destination burst length minus 1, between 0 and 63 The burst length unit is one data named beat within a burst. If DBL_1[5:0] =0 , the burst can be named as single. Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width DDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size. Transfer performance is lower, with GPDMA re-arbitration between effective and lower singles/bursts, but the data integrity is guaranteed.

This bit can only be read by a secure software. This bit must be written by a secure software when GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx = 1. A secure write is ignored when GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx = 0. When GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx is deasserted, this DSEC bit is also deasserted by hardware (on a secure reconfiguration of the channel as non-secure), and the GPDMA transfer to the destination is non-secure.

The user must not assign a same input hardware request (same REQSEL[5:0] value) to different active GPDMA channels (GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1 and GPDMA_CxTR2.SWREQ = 0 for these channels). GPDMA is not intended to hardware support the case of simultaneous enabled channels incorrectly configured with a same hardware peripheral request signal, and there is no user setting error reporting.

When the channel is enabled, this field becomes read-only and is decremented, indicating the remaining number of data items in the current source block to be transferred. BNDT[15:0] is programmed in number of bytes, maximum source block size is 64 Kbytes -1. Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer. Note: A non-null source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: When configured in packing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.PAM[1] = 1 and destination data width different from source data width), a non-null source block size must be a multiple of the destination data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0]).

During the channel activity, depending on the source addressing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC), this field is kept fixed or incremented by the data width (GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]) after each burst source data, reflecting the next address from which data is read. During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC.

Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

BNDT[15:0] is programmed in number of bytes, maximum source block size is 64 Kbytes -1. Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x50020264 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]).

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size.

Else, this bit can be asserted by software. Writing 0 into this EN bit is ignored.
0x500202E4 C   FIELD 01w01 RESET (wo): reset This bit is write only. Writing 0 has no impact. Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).
0x500202E4 C   FIELD 02w01 SUSP (rw): suspend Writing 1 into the field RESET (bit 1) causes the hardware to de-assert this bit, whatever is written into this bit 2. Else: Software must write 1 in order to suspend an active channel (channel with an ongoing GPDMA transfer over its master ports). The software must write 0 in order to resume a suspended channel, following the programming sequence detailed in Figure 43.

0x50020310 C   FIELD 00w02 SDW_LOG2 (rw): binary logarithm of the source data width of a burst in bytes Setting a 8-byte data width causes a user setting error to be reported and no transfer is issued. A source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: A source burst transfer must have an aligned address with its data width (start address GPDMA_CxSAR[2:0] versus SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Otherwise, a user setting error is reported and none transfer is issued.

Each data/beat has a width defined by the destination data width SDW_LOG2[1:0]. Note: If a burst transfer crossed a 1-Kbyte address boundary on a AHB transfer, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol. Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, the GPDMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into singles or bursts of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size. Transfer performance is lower, with GPDMA re-arbitration between effective and lower singles/bursts, but the data integrity is guaranteed.

When GPDMA_SECCFGR.SECx is deasserted, this SSEC bit is also deasserted by hardware (on a secure reconfiguration of the channel as non-secure), and the GPDMA transfer from the source is non-secure.
0x50020310 C   FIELD 16w02 DDW_LOG2 (rw): binary logarithm of the destination data width of a burst, in bytes Setting a 8-byte data width causes a user setting error to be reported and none transfer is issued.

Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] = 0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. Note: If the initial LLIsub0 /subdata transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] =0 ), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLIsub1/sub.

Once the last data transfer is completed (BNDT[15:0] = 0): - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 1, this field is updated by the LLI in the memory. - if GPDMA_CxLLR.UB1 = 0 and if there is at least one non null Uxx update bit, this field is internally restored to the programmed value. - if all GPDMA_CxLLR.Uxx = 0 and if GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:0] = 0, this field is internally restored to the programmed value (infinite/continuous last LLI). - if GPDMA_CxLLR = 0, this field is kept as zero following the last LLI data transfer. Note: A non-null source block size must be a multiple of the source data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued. Note: When configured in packing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.PAM[1] = 1 and destination data width different from source data width), a non-null source block size must be a multiple of the destination data width (BNDT[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0]).

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1. Note: A source address must be aligned with the programmed data width of a source burst (SA[2:0] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]). Else, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1.

Writing 1 implies the reset of the following: the FIFO, the channel internal state, SUSP and EN bits (whatever is written receptively in bit 2 and bit 0). The reset is effective when the channel is in steady state, meaning one of the following: - active channel in suspended state (GPDMA_CxSR.SUSPF = 1 and GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 1) - channel in disabled state (GPDMA_CxSR.IDLEF = 1 and GPDMA_CxCR.EN = 0). After writing a RESET, to continue using this channel, the user must explicitly reconfigure the channel including the hardware-modified configuration registers (GPDMA_CxBR1, GPDMA_CxSAR and GPDMA_CxDAR) before enabling again the channel (see the programming sequence in Figure 44).

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed source burst, consequently to: the programmed source burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.SINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.SBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.SDW_LOG2[21:0] the additional source incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.SDEC In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.USA = 1.

During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1[5:0] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2[1:0] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1.

It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the AES_ICR register.
0x520C0004 C   FIELD 03w01 BUSY (ro): Busy This flag indicates whether AES is idle or busy. AES is flagged as idle when disabled or when the last processing is completed. AES is flagged as busy when processing a block data, preparing a key (ECB or CBC decryption only), or transferring a shared key from SAES peripheral. When GCM encryption is selected, this flag must be at zero before suspending current process to manage a higher-priority message.
0x520C0004 C   FIELD 07w01 KEYVALID (ro): Key valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the key of size defined by KEYSIZE is loaded in AES_KEYRx key registers. The EN bit can only be set when KEYVALID is set. In normal mode when KEYSEL[2:0] is at 000, the key must be written in the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag is set and KEYVALID remains cleared. When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, the BUSY flag is automatically set by AES. When the key is loaded successfully, BUSY is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, KEIF is set, BUSY cleared and KEYVALID remains cleared. If set, KEIF must be cleared through the AES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF flag description for more details. For further information on key loading, refer to Section23.4.18: AES key registers.

A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF flag set), virtually reads a complete 16-byte block of output data from the AES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0].
0x520C0010 B  REGISTER KEYR0: AES key register 0
0x520C0010 C   FIELD 00w32 KEY (wo): Cryptographic key, bits [31:0] This write-only bitfield contains the bits [31:0] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode MODE[1:0] in AES_CR. The AES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the AES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the AES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the AES_SR register. Note that, if KMOD[1:0] is at 10 (shared key), the key is directly loaded from SAES peripheral to AES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set).

0x520C0408 C   FIELD 00w05 NBLW (rw): Number of valid bits in the last word When the last word of the message bit string is written in HASH_DIN register, the hash processor takes only the valid bits specified as below, after internal data swapping: ... The above mechanism is valid only if DCAL = 0. If NBLW[4:0] bitfield is written while DCAL is set to 1, the NBLW[4:0] bitfield remains unchanged. In other words it is not possible to configure NBLW[4:0] and set DCAL at the same time. Reading NBLW[4:0] bitfield returns the last value written to NBLW[4:0].
0x520C0408 C   FIELD 08w01 DCAL (rw): Digest calculation Writing this bit to 1 starts the message padding, using the previously written value of NBLW[4:0], and starts the calculation of the final message digest with all data words written to the input FIFO since the INIT bit was last written to 1. Reading this bit returns 0.

0x520C0424 C   FIELD 09w05 NBWP (ro): Number of words already pushed This bitfield is the exact number of words in the message that have already been pushed into the FIFO. NBWP is incremented by one when a write access is performed to the HASH_DIN register. When a digest calculation starts, NBWP is updated to NBWP- block size (in words), and NBWP goes to zero when the INIT bit is written to 1.
0x520C0424 C   FIELD 15w01 DINNE (ro): DIN not empty This bit is set when the HASH_DIN register holds valid data (that is after being written at least once). It is cleared when either the INIT bit (initialization) or the DCAL bit (completion of the previous message processing) is written to 1.
0x520C0424 C   FIELD 16w05 NBWE (ro): Number of words expected This bitfield reflects the number of words in the message that must be pushed into the FIFO to trigger a partial computation. NBWE is decremented by 1 when a write access is performed to the HASH_DIN register. NBWE is set to the expected block size +1 in words (0x11) when INIT bit is set in HASH_CR, and it is set to the expected block size when partial digest calculation ends.

0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 00w01 EN (rw): Enable This bit enables/disables the SAES peripheral. At any moment, clearing then setting the bit re-initializes the SAES peripheral. When KMOD[1:0] is different from 00, using IPRST bit is recommended instead. This bit is automatically cleared by hardware upon the completion of the key preparation (MODE[1:0] at 01) and upon the completion of GCM/GMAC/CCM initialization phase. The bit cannot be set as long as KEYVALID=0. The situation is similar for one of the following configurations: 1. KMOD[1:0] at 01 (wrap), CHMOD[2:0] at 11 (GCM) 2. KMOD[1:0] at 01 (wrap), CHMOD[2:0] at 10 (CTR), MODE[1:0] at 00 (encryption).
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 01w02 DATATYPE (rw): Data type This bitfield defines the format of data written in the SAES_DINR register or read from the SAES_DOUTR register, through selecting the mode of data swapping. This swapping is defined in Section23.4.17: SAES data registers and data swapping. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 03w02 MODE (rw): Operating mode This bitfield selects the SAES operating mode: Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.

0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 11w01 DMAINEN (rw): DMA input enable When this bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by the peripheral during the input data phase. Setting this bit is ignored when MODE[1:0] is at 01 (key derivation).
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 12w01 DMAOUTEN (rw): DMA output enable When this bit is set, DMA requests are automatically generated by the peripheral during the output data phase. Setting this bit is ignored when MODE[1:0] is at 01 (key derivation).
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 13w02 GCMPH (rw): GCM or CCM phase selection This bitfield selects the phase, applicable only with GCM, GMAC or CCM chaining modes. This bitfield has no effect if GCM, GMAC or CCM algorithm is not selected with CHMOD[2:0].

0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 18w01 KEYSIZE (rw): Key size selection This bitfield defines the key length in bits of the key used by SAES. When KMOD[1:0] is at 01 or 10, KEYSIZE also defines the length of the key to encrypt or decrypt. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when the EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 19w01 KEYPROT (rw): Key protection When set, hardware-based key protection is enabled. Attempts to write the bit are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 20w04 NPBLB (rw): Number of padding bytes in last block This padding information must be filled by software before processing the last block of GCM payload encryption or CCM payload decryption, otherwise authentication tag computation is incorrect. ...
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 24w02 KMOD (rw): Key mode selection The bitfield defines how the SAES key can be used by the application. KEYSIZE must be correctly initialized when setting KMOD[1:0] different from zero. Others: Reserved With KMOD[1:0] other than zero, any attempt to configure the SAES peripheral for use by an application belonging to a different security domain (such as secure or non-secure) results in automatic key erasure and setting of the KEIF flag. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 26w02 KSHAREID (rw): Key share identification This bitfield defines, at the end of a decryption process with KMOD[1:0] at 10 (shared key), which target can read the SAES key registers using a dedicated hardware bus. Others: Reserved Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when BUSY is set, as well as when EN is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 28w03 KEYSEL (rw): Key selection The bitfield defines the source of the key information to use in the AES cryptographic core. Others: Reserved (if used, unfreeze SAES with IPRST) When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, selected key value is available in key registers when BUSY bit is cleared and KEYVALID is set in the SAES_SR register. Otherwise, the key error flag KEIF is set. Repeated writing of KEYSEL[2:0] with the same non-zero value only triggers the loading of DHUK or BHK when KEYVALIDis cleared. When the application software changes the key selection by writing the KEYSEL[2:0] bitfield, the key registers are immediately erased and the KEYVALID flag cleared. At the end of the decryption process, if KMOD[1:0] is other than zero, KEYSEL[2:0] is cleared. With the bitfield value other than zero and KEYVALID set, the application cannot transfer the ownership of SAES with a loaded key to an application running in another security context (such as secure, non-secure). More specifically, when security of an access to any register does not match the information recorded by SAES, the KEIF flag is set. Attempts to write the bitfield are ignored when the BUSY flag of SAES_SR register is set, as well as when the EN bit of the SAES_CR register is set before the write access and it is not cleared by that write access.
0x520C0C00 C   FIELD 31w01 IPRST (rw): SAES peripheral software reset Setting the bit resets the SAES peripheral, putting all registers to their default values, except the IPRST bit itself. Hence, any key-relative data are lost. For this reason, it is recommended to set the bit before handing over the SAES to a less secure application. The bit must be low while writing any configuration registers.
0x520C0C04 B  REGISTER SR: SAES status register
0x520C0C04 C   FIELD 01w01 RDERRF (ro): Read error flag This bit is set when an unexpected read to the SAES_DOUTR register occurred. When set RDERRF bit has no impact on the SAES operations. This flag is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit in SAES_ICR register. If RWEIE bit is set in SAES_IER register an interrupt is generated when RDERRF is set. It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register.
0x520C0C04 C   FIELD 02w01 WRERRF (ro): Write error flag This bit is set when an unexpected write to the SAES_DINR register occurred. When set WRERRF bit has no impact on the SAES operations. This flag is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit in SAES_ICR register. If RWEIE bit is set in SAES_IER register an interrupt is generated when WRERRF is set. It is cleared by setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register.
0x520C0C04 C   FIELD 03w01 BUSY (ro): Busy This flag indicates whether SAES is idle or busy. SAES is flagged as idle when disabled or when the last processing is completed. SAES is flagged as busy when processing a block data, preparing a key (ECB or CBC decryption only), fetching random number from the RNG, or transferring a shared key to target peripheral. When GCM encryption is selected, this flag must be at zero before suspending current process to manage a higher-priority message. BUSY must also be cleared before selecting the GCM final phase.
0x520C0C04 C   FIELD 07w01 KEYVALID (ro): Key valid flag This bit is set by hardware when the key of size defined by KEYSIZE is loaded in SAES_KEYRx key registers. The EN bit can only be set when KEYVALID is set. In normal mode when KEYSEL[2:0] is at 000, the key must be written in the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag is set and KEYVALID remains cleared. When KEYSEL[2:0] is different from zero, the BUSY flag is automatically set by SAES. When the key is loaded successfully, BUSY is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, KEIF is set, BUSY cleared and KEYVALID remains cleared. If set, KEIF must be cleared through the SAES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF flag description for more details. For further information on key loading, refer to Section23.4.18: SAES key registers.
0x520C0C08 B  REGISTER DINR: SAES data input register
0x520C0C08 C   FIELD 00w32 DIN (wo): Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the Input phase results in writing a complete 16-bytes block of input data to the SAES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield, then written into the AES core 16-bytes input buffer. Reads return zero.
0x520C0C0C B  REGISTER DOUTR: SAES data output register
0x520C0C0C C   FIELD 00w32 DOUT (ro): Output data word This read-only bitfield fetches a 32-bit output buffer. A four-fold sequential read of this bitfield, upon the computation completion (CCF flag set), virtually reads a complete 16-byte block of output data from the SAES peripheral. Before reaching the output buffer, the data produced by the AES core are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE[1:0] bitfield. Data weights from the first to the fourth read operation are: [127:96], [95:64], [63:32], and [31:0].
0x520C0C10 B  REGISTER KEYR0: SAES key register 0
0x520C0C10 C   FIELD 00w32 KEY (wo): Cryptographic key, bits [31:0] This write-only bitfield contains the bits [31:0] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode MODE[1:0] in SAES_CR. The SAES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the SAES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the SAES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the SAES_SR register. Note that, if KEYSEL[2:0] is different from 0 and KEYVALID=0, the key is directly loaded to SAES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set). When KEYVALID is set a write to this register clears KEYVALID if SAES is disabled.

Refer to Section23.4.8: SAES suspend and resume operations for more details. Read to this register returns zero when EN bit is cleared in SAES_SR register. SAES_SUSPRx registers are not used in other chaining modes than CCM.
0x520C0F00 B  REGISTER IER: SAES interrupt enable register
0x520C0F00 C   FIELD 00w01 CCFIE (rw): Computation complete flag interrupt enable This bit enables or disables (masks) the SAES interrupt generation when CCF (computation complete flag) is set.
0x520C0F00 C   FIELD 01w01 RWEIE (rw): Read or write error interrupt enable This bit enables or disables (masks) the SAES interrupt generation when RWEIF (read and/or write error flag) is set.

0x520C0F04 B  REGISTER ISR: SAES interrupt status register
0x520C0F04 C   FIELD 00w01 CCF (ro): Computation complete flag This flag indicates whether the computation is completed. It is significant only when the DMAOUTEN bit is cleared, and it may stay high when DMAOUTEN is set. CCF bit is cleared when application sets the corresponding bit of AES_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if the CCFIE bit has been previously set in the AES_IER register.
0x520C0F04 C   FIELD 01w01 RWEIF (ro): Read or write error interrupt flag This read-only bit is set by hardware when a RDERRF or a WRERRF error flag is set in the SAES_SR register. RWEIF bit is cleared when application sets the corresponding bit of SAES_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if the RWEIE bit has been previously set in the SAES_IER register. This flags has no meaning when key derivation mode is selected.
0x520C0F04 C   FIELD 02w01 KEIF (ro): Key error interrupt flag This read-only bit is set by hardware when key information failed to load into key registers or key register usage is forbidden. Setting the corresponding bit of the SAES_ICR register clears the KEIF and generates interrupt if the KEIE bit of the SAES_IER register is set. KEIF is triggered upon any of the following errors: SAES fails to load the DHUK (KEYSEL[2:0]=001 or 100). SAES fails to load the BHK (KEYSEL[2:0]=010 or 100) respecting the correct order. AES fails to load the key shared by SAES peripheral (KMOD=10). When KEYVALID is set and either KEYPROT is set or KEYSEL[2:0] is other than 000, the security context of the application that loads the key (secure or non-secure) does not match the security attribute of the access to SAES_CR or SAES_DOUT. In this case, KEYVALID and EN bits are cleared. SAES_KEYRx register write does not respect the correct order. (For KEYSIZE=0, SAES_KEYR0 then SAES_KEYR1 then SAES_KEYR2 then SAES_KEYR3 register, or reverse. For KEYSIZE set, SAES_KEYR0 then SAES_KEYR1 then SAES_KEYR2 then SAES_KEYR3 then SAES_KEYR4 then SAES_KEYR5 then SAES_KEYR6 then SAES_KEYR7, or reverse). KEIF must be cleared by the application software, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set.
0x520C0F04 C   FIELD 03w01 RNGEIF (ro): RNG error interrupt flag This read-only bit is set by hardware when an error is detected on RNG bus interface (e.g. bad entropy). RNGEIE bit is cleared when application sets the corresponding bit of SAES_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if the RNGEIE bit has been previously set in the SAES_IER register. Clearing this bit triggers the reload of a new random number from RNG peripheral.

0x56002000 B  REGISTER CR1: SPI control register 1
0x56002000 C   FIELD 00w01 SPE (rw): serial peripheral enable This bit is set by and cleared by software. When SPE = 1, SPI data transfer is enabled, SPI_CFG1 and SPI_CFG2 configuration registers, CRCPOLY, UDRDR, part of SPI_AUTOCR register and IOLOCK bit in the SPI_CR1 register are write protected. They can be changed only when SPE = 0. When SPE = 0 any SPI operation is stopped and disabled, all the pending requests of the events with enabled interrupt are blocked except the MODF interrupt request (but their pending still propagates the request of the spi_plck clock), the SS output is deactivated at master, the RDY signal keeps not ready status at slave, the internal state machine is reseted, all the FIFOs content is flushed, CRC calculation initialized, receive data register is read zero. SPE is cleared and cannot be set when MODF error flag is active.
0x56002000 C   FIELD 08w01 MASRX (rw): master automatic suspension in Receive mode This bit is set and cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition. When SPI communication is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay. This is why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared, the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent any subsequent suspension.
0x56002000 C   FIELD 09w01 CSTART (rw): master transfer start This bit can be set by software if SPI is enabled only to start an SPI communication. it is cleared by hardware when end of transfer (EOT) flag is set or when a transaction suspend request is accepted. In SPI mode, the bit is taken into account at master mode only. If transmission is enabled, communication starts or continues only if any data is available in the transmission FIFO.
0x56002000 C   FIELD 10w01 CSUSP (wo): master suspend request This bit reads as zero. In Master mode, when this bit is set by software, the CSTART bit is reset at the end of the current frame and communication is suspended. The user has to check SUSP flag to check end of the frame transaction. The Master mode communication must be suspended (using this bit or keeping TXDR empty) before going to Low-power mode. Can be used in SPI or I2S mode. After software suspension, SUSP flag must be cleared and SPI disabled and re-enabled before the next transaction starts.
0x56002000 C   FIELD 11w01 HDDIR (rw): Rx/Tx direction at Half-duplex mode In Half-Duplex configuration the HDDIR bit establishes the Rx/Tx direction of the data transfer. This bit is ignored in Full-Duplex or any Simplex configuration.
0x56002000 C   FIELD 12w01 SSI (rw): internal SS signal input level This bit has an effect only when the SSM bit is set. The value of this bit is forced onto the peripheral SS input internally and the I/O value of the SS pin is ignored.

0x56002000 C   FIELD 16w01 IOLOCK (rw): locking the AF configuration of associated I/Os This bit is set by software and cleared by hardware whenever the SPE bit is changed from 1 to 0. When this bit is set, SPI_CFG2 register content cannot be modified. This bit can be set when SPI is disabled only else it is write protected. It is cleared and cannot be set when MODF bit is set.

0x56002004 C   FIELD 00w16 TSIZE (rw): number of data at current transfer When these bits are changed by software, the SPI must be disabled. Endless transaction is initialized when CSTART is set while zero value is stored at TSIZE. TSIZE cannot be set to 0xFFFF respective 0x3FFF value when CRC is enabled. Note: TSIZE[15:10] bits are reserved at limited feature set instances and must be kept at reset value.

0x56002008 C   FIELD 00w05 DSIZE (rw): number of bits in at single SPI data frame ..... Maximum data size can be limited up to 16-bits at some instances. At instances with limited set of features, DSIZE2:0] bits are reserved and must be kept at reset state. DSIZE[4:3] bits then control next settings of data size: 00xxx: 8-bits 01xxx: 16-bits 10xxx: 24-bits Note: 11xxx: 32-bits.
0x56002008 C   FIELD 05w04 FTHLV (rw): FIFO threshold level Defines number of data frames at single data packet. Size of the packet should not exceed 1/2 of FIFO space. SPI interface is more efficient if configured packet sizes are aligned with data register access parallelism: If SPI data register is accessed as a 16-bit register and DSIZE less than or equal 8 bit, better to select FTHLV = 2, 4, 6. If SPI data register is accessed as a 32-bit register and DSIZE 8 bit, better to select FTHLV = 2, 4, 6, while if DSIZE less than or equal 8bit, better to select FTHLV = 4, 8, 12. Note: FTHLV[3:2] bits are reserved at instances with limited set of features

This feature is not supported in TI mode. Note: To include the delay, the SPI must be disabled and re-enabled between sessions.
0x5600200C C   FIELD 04w04 MIDI (rw): master Inter-Data Idleness Specifies minimum time delay (expressed in SPI clock cycles periods) inserted between two consecutive data frames in Master mode. ... Note: This feature is not supported in TI mode.
0x5600200C C   FIELD 13w01 RDIOM (rw): RDY signal input/output management Note: When DSIZE at the SPI_CFG1 register is configured shorter than 8-bit, the RDIOM bit must be kept at zero.

0x56002014 B  REGISTER SR: SPI status register
0x56002014 C   FIELD 00w01 RXP (ro): Rx-Packet available In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: RxFIFO level is lower than FTHLV In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: RxFIFO level is higher or equal to FTHLV RXP flag is changed by hardware. It monitors number of overall data currently available at RxFIFO if SPI is enabled. It must be checked once a data packet is completely read out from RxFIFO.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 01w01 TXP (ro): Tx-Packet space available In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: there is less than FTHLV free locations in the TxFIFO In I2S mode, it must be interpreted as follow: there is FTHLV or more than FTHLV free locations in the TxFIFO TXP flag is changed by hardware. It monitors overall space currently available at TxFIFO no matter if SPI is enabled or not. It must be checked once a complete data packet is stored at TxFIFO.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 02w01 DXP (ro): duplex packet DXP flag is set whenever both TXP and RXP flags are set regardless SPI mode.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 03w01 EOT (ro): end of transfer EOT is set by hardware as soon as a full transfer is complete, that is when SPI is re-enabled or when TSIZE number of data have been transmitted and/or received on the SPI. EOT is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to EOTC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. EOT flag triggers an interrupt if EOTIE bit is set. If DXP flag is used until TXTF flag is set and DXPIE is cleared, EOT can be used to download the last packets contained into RxFIFO in one-shot. In master, EOT event terminates the data transaction and handles SS output optionally. When CRC is applied, the EOT event is extended over the CRC frame transaction. To restart the internal state machine properly, SPI is strongly suggested to be disabled and re-enabled before next transaction starts despite its setting is not changed.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 04w01 TXTF (ro): transmission transfer filled TXTF is set by hardware as soon as all of the data packets in a transfer have been submitted for transmission by application software or DMA, that is when TSIZE number of data have been pushed into the TxFIFO. This bit is cleared by software write 1 to TXTFC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively. TXTF flag triggers an interrupt if TXTFIE bit is set. TXTF setting clears the TXPIE and DXPIE masks so to off-load application software from calculating when to disable TXP and DXP interrupts.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 05w01 UDR (ro): underrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to UDRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally. Note: In SPI mode, the UDR flag applies to Slave mode only. In I2S/PCM mode, (when available) this flag applies to Master and Slave mode
0x56002014 C   FIELD 06w01 OVR (ro): overrun This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to OVRC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 07w01 CRCE (ro): CRC error This bit is cleared when SPI is re-enabled or by writing 1 to CRCEC bit of SPI_IFCR optionally.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 08w01 TIFRE (ro): TI frame format error This bit is cleared by writing 1 to TIFREC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 09w01 MODF (ro): mode fault This bit is cleared by writing 1 to MODFC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 11w01 SUSP (ro): suspension status In Master mode, SUSP is set by hardware either as soon as the current frame is completed after CSUSP request is done or at master automatic suspend receive mode (MASRX bit is set at SPI_CR1 register) on RxFIFO full condition. SUSP generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set. This bit must be cleared prior SPI is disabled and this is done by writing 1 to SUSPC bit of SPI_IFCR exclusively.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 12w01 TXC (ro): TxFIFO transmission complete The flag behavior depends on TSIZE setting. When TSIZE = 0 the TXC is changed by hardware exclusively and it raises each time the TxFIFO becomes empty and there is no activity on the bus. If TSIZE different 0 there is no specific reason to monitor TXC as it just copies the EOT flag value including its software clearing. The TXC generates an interrupt when EOTIE is set.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 13w02 RXPLVL (ro): RxFIFO packing level When RXWNE = 0 and data size is set up to 16-bit, the value gives number of remaining data frames persisting at RxFIFO. Note: (*): Optional value when data size is set up to 8-bit only. When data size is greater than 16-bit, these bits are always read as 00. In that consequence, the single data frame received at the FIFO cannot be detected neither by RWNE nor by RXPLVL bits if data size is set from 17 to 24 bits. The user then must apply other methods like TSIZE 0 or FTHLV = 0.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 15w01 RXWNE (ro): RxFIFO word not empty Note: This bit value does not depend on DSIZE setting and keeps together with RXPLVL[1:0] information about RxFIFO occupancy by residual data.
0x56002014 C   FIELD 16w16 CTSIZE (ro): number of data frames remaining in current TSIZE session The value is not quite reliable when traffic is ongoing on bus or during autonomous operation in low-power mode. Note: CTSIZE[15:0] bits are not available in instances with limited set of features.

Unused bits are ignored when writing to the register, and read as zero when the register is read. Note: DR can be accessed byte-wise (8-bit access): in this case only one data-byte is written by single access. Note: halfword-wise (16 bit access) in this case 2 data-bytes or 1 halfword-data can be written by single access. Note: word-wise (32 bit access).

0x56002040 C   FIELD 00w32 CRCPOLY (rw): CRC polynomial register This register contains the polynomial for the CRC calculation. The default 9-bit polynomial setting 0x107 corresponds to default 8-bit setting of DSIZE. It is compatible with setting 0x07 used in other ST products with fixed length of the polynomial string, where the most significant bit of the string is always kept hidden. Length of the polynomial is given by the most significant bit of the value stored in this register. It must be set greater than DSIZE. CRC33_17 bit must be set additionally with CRCPOLY register when DSIZE is configured to maximum 32-bit or 16-bit size and CRC is enabled (to keep polynomial length grater than data size). Note: CRCPOLY[31:16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.
0x56002044 B  REGISTER TXCRC: SPI transmitter CRC register
0x56002044 C   FIELD 00w32 TXCRC (ro): CRC register for transmitter When CRC calculation is enabled, the TXCRC[31:0] bits contain the computed CRC value of the subsequently transmitted bytes. CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: TXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register. The number of bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits settings at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: a read to this register when the communication is ongoing could return an incorrect value. Note: RXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

The number of bits considered depends on DSIZE bit settings of the SPI_CFG1 register. Underrun condition handling depends on setting UDRCFG bit at SPI_CFG1 register. Note: UDRDR[31-16] bits are reserved at the peripheral instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constraint when 32-bit access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero while any write to them is ignored.

0x56002400 C   FIELD 00w01 UE (rw): LPUART enable When this bit is cleared, the LPUART prescalers and outputs are stopped immediately, and current operations are discarded. The configuration of the LPUART is kept, but all the status flags, in the LPUART_ISR are reset. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: To enter low-power mode without generating errors on the line, the TE bit must be reset before and the software must wait for the TC bit in the LPUART_ISR to be set before resetting the UE bit. Note: The DMA requests are also reset when UE = 0 so the DMA channel must be disabled before resetting the UE bit.
0x56002400 C   FIELD 01w01 UESM (rw): LPUART enable in low-power mode When this bit is cleared, the LPUART cannot request its kernel clock and is not functional in low-power mode. When this bit is set, the LPUART can wake up the MCU from low-power mode. This bit is set and cleared by software. Note: The UESM bit must be set at the initialization phase. Note: If the LPUART does not support the Wakeup from low-power mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 79.3: LPUART implementation on page 4652.
0x56002400 C   FIELD 02w01 RE (rw): Receiver enable This bit enables the receiver. It is set and cleared by software.
0x56002400 C   FIELD 03w01 TE (rw): Transmitter enable This bit enables the transmitter. When the Autonomous mode is not used, TE bit is set and cleared by software. When the Autonomous mode is used, TE bit becomes a status bit, which is set and cleared by hardware. Note: During transmission, a low pulse on the TE bit (0 followed by 1) sends a preamble (idle line) after the current word, except in Smartcard mode. In order to generate an idle character, the TE must not be immediately written to 1. To ensure the required duration, the software can poll the TEACK bit in the USART_ISR register. Note: In Smartcard mode, when TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.

0x56002418 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request This bit is used when FIFO mode is enabled. TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the flag TXFE (TXFIFO empty, bit 23 in the LPUART_ISR register). Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.

0x5600241C C   FIELD 02w01 NE (ro): Start bit noise detection flag This bit is set by hardware when noise is detected on the start bit of a received frame. It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: This error is associated with the character in the LPUART_RDR.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 03w01 ORE (ro): Overrun error This bit is set by hardware when the data currently being received in the shift register is ready to be transferred into the LPUART_RDR register while RXFF = 1. It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the LPUART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 or EIE = 1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: When this bit is set, the LPUART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set.

It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXFNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME=1), IDLE is set if the LPUART is not mute (RWU=0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU=1, IDLE is not set.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, and so data can be read from the LPUART_RDR register. Every read of the LPUART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. It is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the LPUART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 06w01 TC (ro): Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the LPUART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register. The TC flag behaves as follows: When TDN = 0, the TC flag is set when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXFE is set. When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. TC bit is cleared by software by writing 1 to the TCCF in the LPUART_ICR register or by writing to the LPUART_TDR register.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 07w01 TXFNF (ro): TXFIFO not full TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full, and so data can be written in the LPUART_TDR. Every write in the LPUART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the LPUART_TDR. The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time). An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 09w01 CTSIF (ro): CTS interrupt flag This bit is set by hardware when the CTS input toggles, if the CTSE bit is set.

0x5600241C C   FIELD 19w01 RWU (ro): Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the LPUART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the LPUART_CR1 register. When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the LPUART_RQR register. Note: If the LPUART does not support the wakeup from Stop feature, this bit is reserved and kept at reset value.
0x5600241C C   FIELD 21w01 TEACK (ro): Transmit enable acknowledge flag This bit is set/reset by hardware, when the Transmit Enable value is taken into account by the LPUART.

Since this counter counts down, this operation effectively subtracts from (delays) the clock by: Delay (seconds) = SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1) A fraction of a second can effectively be added to the clock (advancing the clock) when the ADD1S function is used in conjunction with SUBFS, effectively advancing the clock by: Advance (seconds) = (1 - (SUBFS / (PREDIV_S + 1))). In mixed BCD-binary mode (BIN=10 or 11), the SUBFS[14:BCDU+8] must be written with 0. Note: Writing to SUBFS causes RSF to be cleared. Software can then wait until RSF = 1 to be sure that the shadow registers have been updated with the shifted time.
0x5600782C C   FIELD 31w01 ADD1S (wo): Add one second This bit is write only and is always read as zero. Writing to this bit has no effect when a shift operation is pending (when SHPF = 1, in RTC_ICSR). This function is intended to be used with SUBFS (see description below) in order to effectively add a fraction of a second to the clock in an atomic operation.

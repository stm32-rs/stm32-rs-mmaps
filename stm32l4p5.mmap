Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

Note: It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 00111).

0x40004C10 C   FIELD 08w08 GT (rw): Guard time value This bitfield is used to program the Guard time value in terms of number of baud clock periods. This is used in Smartcard mode. The Transmission Complete flag is set after this guard time value. This bitfield can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE = 0). Note: If Smartcard mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. Refer to Section 33.4: USART implementation on page 1038.

0x40004C14 C   FIELD 00w24 RTO (rw): Receiver timeout value This bitfield gives the Receiver timeout value in terms of number of bits during which there is no activity on the RX line. In standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
0x40004C14 C   FIELD 24w08 BLEN (rw): Block length This bitfield gives the Block length in Smartcard T = 1 Reception. Its value equals the number of information characters + the length of the Epilogue Field (1-LEC/2-CRC) - 1. Examples: BLEN = 0: 0 information characters + LEC BLEN = 1: 0 information characters + CRC BLEN = 255: 254 information characters + CRC (total 256 characters)) In Smartcard mode, the Block length counter is reset when TXE = 0 (TXFE = 0 in case FIFO mode is enabled). This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE = 0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.

0x40004C18 C   FIELD 01w01 SBKRQ (wo): Send break request Writing 1 to this bit sets the SBKF flag and request to send a BREAK on the line, as soon as the transmit machine is available. Note: When the application needs to send the break character following all previously inserted data, including the ones not yet transmitted, the software should wait for the TXE flag assertion before setting the SBKRQ bit.
0x40004C18 C   FIELD 02w01 MMRQ (wo): Mute mode request Writing 1 to this bit puts the USART in Mute mode and resets the RWU flag.
0x40004C18 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This enables to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x40004C18 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This enables to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data have not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.

0x40005004 C   FIELD 24w08 ADD (rw): Address of the USART node These bits give the address of the USART node in Mute mode or a character code to be recognized in low-power or Run mode: In Mute mode: they are used in multiprocessor communication to wakeup from Mute mode with 4-bit/7-bit address mark detection. The MSB of the character sent by the transmitter should be equal to 1. In 4-bit address mark detection, only ADD[3:0] bits are used. In low-power mode: they are used for wake up from low-power mode on character match. When WUS[1:0] is programmed to 0b00 (WUF active on address match), the wakeup from low-power mode is performed when the received character corresponds to the character programmed through ADD[6:0] or ADD[3:0] bitfield (depending on ADDM7 bit), and WUF interrupt is enabled by setting WUFIE bit. The MSB of the character sent by transmitter should be equal to 1. In Run mode with Mute mode inactive (for example, end-of-block detection in ModBus protocol): the whole received character (8 bits) is compared to ADD[7:0] value and CMF flag is set on match. An interrupt is generated if the CMIE bit is set. These bits can only be written when the reception is disabled (RE = 0) or when the USART is disabled (UE = 0).

If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and must be kept at reset value. When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO. This sets the TXFE flag (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes. Note: In FIFO mode, the TXFNF flag is reset during the flush request until TxFIFO is empty in order to ensure that no data are written in the data register.

It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the IDLECF in the USART_ICR register. Note: The IDLE bit is not set again until the RXNE bit has been set (i.e. a new idle line occurs). Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME = 1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU = 0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU = 1, IDLE is not set.
0x4000501C C   FIELD 05w01 RXFNE (ro): RXFIFO not empty RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, meaning that data can be read from the USART_RDR register.

When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time).

Codes above 1000: Reserved. Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal. Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the TRGO or the TRGO2 signals must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the master timer.

Note: Setting the ECE bit has the same effect as selecting external clock mode 1 with TRGI connected to ETRF (SMS=111 and TS=00111). It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 00111). Note: If external clock mode 1 and external clock mode 2 are enabled at the same time, the external clock input is ETRF.

0x40012C48 B  REGISTER DCR: TIM1 DMA control register
0x40012C48 C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x40012C48 C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIMx_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIMx_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data is copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data is transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data is also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

Codes above 1000: Reserved. Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS=00100). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.

It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 00111).

0x40013448 B  REGISTER DCR: TIM8 DMA control register
0x40013448 C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x40013448 C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIMx_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIMx_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data is copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data is transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data is also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

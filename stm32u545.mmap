The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer.

The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer.

0x40020794 C   FIELD 09w01 SWREQ: Software request When GPDMA_CxCR.EN is asserted, this field is internally taken into account: - 0: no software request. The selected hardware request REQSEL[6:0] is taken into account. - 1: software request (for a memory-to-memory transfer). And the default selected hardware request as per REQSEL[6:0] is ignored.

Else: - 0: the selected hardware request is driven by a source peripheral (i.e. this request signal is taken into account by the DMA transfer scheduler over the source/read port) - 1: the selected hardware request is driven by a destination peripheral (.e. this request signal is taken into account by the DMA transfer scheduler over the destination/write port)

0x40020794 C   FIELD 14w02 TRIGM: Trigger mode: enabled. Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when GPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

Transfer performance is lower, with DMA re-arbitration between effective and lower burst(s)/singles, but data integrity is guaranteed.

Else, the selected hardware request as per Table 12 is internally taken into account. Note: The user must not assign a same input hardware request (i.e. a same REQSEL[6:0] value) to different active DMA channels (i.e. if GPDMA_CxCR.EN=1 and GPDMA_CxTR2.SWREQ=0 for the related x channels). In other words, DMA is not intended to hardware support the case of simultaneous enabled channels having been -incorrectly- configured with a same hardware peripheral request signal, and there is no user setting error reporting.
0x40020814 C   FIELD 09w01 SWREQ: Software request When GPDMA_CxCR.EN is asserted, this field is internally taken into account: - 0: no software request. The selected hardware request REQSEL[6:0] is taken into account. - 1: software request (for a memory-to-memory transfer). And the default selected hardware request as per REQSEL[6:0] is ignored.

Else: - 0: the selected hardware request is driven by a source peripheral (i.e. this request signal is taken into account by the DMA transfer scheduler over the source/read port) - 1: the selected hardware request is driven by a destination peripheral (.e. this request signal is taken into account by the DMA transfer scheduler over the destination/write port)

Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when GPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address LPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the LPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

The channel transfer is completed without any update of the linked-list DMA register file. Else, this field is the pointer to the memory address offset from which the next linked-list data structure will be automatically fetched from, once the data transfer is completed, in order to conditionally update the linked-list DMA internal register file i.e. possibly LPDMA_CxCTR1, LPDMA_CxTR2, LPDMA_CxBR1, LPDMA_CxSAR, LPDMA_CxDAR and LPDMA_CxLLR. Note: The user should program the pointer to be 32-bit aligned. The two low significant bits are write ignored.

Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when GPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register.

Else a user setting error is reported and none transfer is issued.Note: If a burst transfer would have crossed a 1kB address boundary on a AHB transfer, internally DMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into single(s) or burst(s) of lower length, to be compliant with the AHB protocol.Note: If a burst transfer is of length greater than the FIFO size of the channel x, internally DMA modifies and shortens the programmed burst into single(s) or burst(s) of lower length, to be compliant with the FIFO size. Transfer performance is lower, with DMA re-arbitration between effective and lower burst(s)/singles, but data integrity is guaranteed.

Else, the selected hardware request as per Table 12 is internally taken into account. Note: The user must not assign a same input hardware request (i.e. a same REQSEL[6:0] value) to different active DMA channels (i.e. if GPDMA_CxCR.EN=1 and GPDMA_CxTR2.SWREQ=0 for the related x channels). In other words, DMA is not intended to hardware support the case of simultaneous enabled channels having been -incorrectly- configured with a same hardware peripheral request signal, and there is no user setting error reporting.

Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when GPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register.

Else, the selected hardware request as per Table 12 is internally taken into account. Note: The user must not assign a same input hardware request (i.e. a same REQSEL[6:0] value) to different active DMA channels (i.e. if GPDMA_CxCR.EN=1 and GPDMA_CxTR2.SWREQ=0 for the related x channels). In other words, DMA is not intended to hardware support the case of simultaneous enabled channels having been -incorrectly- configured with a same hardware peripheral request signal, and there is no user setting error reporting.
0x50020814 C   FIELD 09w01 SWREQ: Software request When GPDMA_CxCR.EN is asserted, this field is internally taken into account: - 0: no software request.

Transferring a next LLIn+1 which updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0] resets the monitoring, trashing the (possible) memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After that a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, this new second trigger hitn+2 is lost and not memorized. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and (SWREQ=1 or (SWREQ=0 and DREQ=0)), the shortened burst transfer (by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. Note: When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by single(s) or/and by burst(s) of lower length (e.g. vs FIFO size, vs block size, 1kB/4kB boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0]=11 and SWREQ=0 and DREQ=1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.

Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when GPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with GPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address GPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the GPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 05w01 LSECSSON (rw): CSS on LSE enable This bit is set by software to enable the CSS on LSE. It must be enabled after the LSE oscillator is enabled (LSEON bit enabled) and ready (LSERDY flag set by hardware), and after the RTCSEL bit is selected. Once enabled, this bit cannot be disabled, except after a LSE failure detection (LSECSSD�=�1). In that case, the software must disable this LSECSSON bit.
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 06w01 LSECSSD (ro): CSS on LSE failure detection This bit is set by hardware to indicate when a failure is detected by the CCS on the external 32�kHz oscillator (LSE).
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 07w01 LSESYSEN (rw): LSE system clock (LSESYS) enable This bit is set by software to enable always the LSE system clock generated by RCC, which can be used by any peripheral when its source clock is the LSE, or at system level if one of LSCOSEL, MCO, or MSI PLL mode is needed.
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 08w02 RTCSEL (rw): RTC and TAMP clock source selection This bit is set by software to select the clock source for the RTC and TAMP. Once the RTC and TAMP clock source has been selected, it cannot be changed anymore unless the�backup domain is reset, or unless a failure is detected on LSE (LSECSSD is set). BDRST bit can be used to reset them.
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 11w01 LSESYSRDY (ro): LSE system clock (LSESYS) ready This bit is set and cleared by hardware to indicate when the LSE system clock is stable.When LSESYSEN is set, this LSESYSRDY flag is set after two LSE clock cycles. The LSE clock must be already enabled and stable (LSEON and LSERDY are set). When the LSEON bit is cleared, LSERDY goes low after six external low-speed oscillator clock cycles.
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 12w01 LSEGFON (rw): LSE clock glitch filter enable This bit is set and cleared by hardware to enable the LSE glitch filter. It can be written only when the LSE is disabled (LSEON = 0 and LSERDY = 0).

0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 27w01 LSIRDY (rw): LSI oscillator ready This bit is set and cleared by hardware to indicate when the LSI oscillator is stable. After�LSION is cleared, LSIRDY goes low after three internal low-speed oscillator clock cycles. This bit is set when the LSI is used by IWDG or RTC, even if LSION = 0.
0x56020CF0 C   FIELD 28w01 LSIPREDIV (rw): Low-speed clock divider configuration This bit is set and cleared by software to enable the LSI division. It can be written only when the LSI is disabled (LSION = 0 and LSIRDY = 0). If the LSI was previously enabled, it is necessary to wait for at least 60 μs after clearing LSION bit (synchronization time for LSI to be really disabled), before writing LSIPREDIV. The LSIPREDIV cannot be changed if the LSI is used by the IWDG or by the RTC.

Else, the selected hardware request as per Table 12 is internally taken into account. Note: The user must not assign a same input hardware request (i.e. a same REQSEL[6:0] value) to different active DMA channels (i.e. if LPDMA_CxCR.EN=1 and LPDMA_CxTR2.SWREQ=0 for the related x channels). In other words, DMA is not intended to hardware support the case of simultaneous enabled channels having been -incorrectly- configured with a same hardware peripheral request signal, and there is no user setting error reporting.
0x56025214 C   FIELD 09w01 SWREQ: Software request When LPDMA_CxCR.EN is asserted, this field is internally taken into account: - 0: no software request. The selected hardware request REQSEL[6:0] is taken into account. - 1: software request (for a memory-to-memory transfer). And the default selected hardware request as per REQSEL[6:0] is ignored.

0x56025214 C   FIELD 14w02 TRIGM: Trigger mode
0x56025214 C   FIELD 16w05 TRIGSEL: Trigger event input selection Note: Selects the trigger event input as per Table 13 of the DMA transfer, with an active trigger event if TRIGPOL[1:0] !=00.
0x56025214 C   FIELD 24w02 TRIGPOL: Trigger event polarity Defines the polarity of the selected trigger event input defined by TRIGSEL[5:0]. - 00: no trigger. Masked trigger event. - 01: trigger on the rising edge - 10: trigger on the falling edge - 11: same as 00
0x56025214 C   FIELD 30w02 TCEM: Transfer complete event mode Defines the transfer granularity for the transfer complete (and half transfer complete) event generation. - 00: at block level (i.e. when LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the (respectively half of the) end of a block. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 01: channel x=0 to 11: same as 00 ;channel x=12 to 15: at 2D/repeated block level (i.e. when LPDMA_CxBR1.BRC[10:0]= 0 and LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]= 0): the complete (and the half) transfer event is generated at the end (respectively half of the end) of the 2D/repeated block Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then neither the complete transfer event nor the half transfer event is generated. - 10: at LLI level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the LLI transfer, including the update of the LLI if any. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the LLI data transfer (the LLI data transfer being a block or a 2D/repeated block transfer), if any data transfer. Note: If the initial LLI0 data transfer is null/void (i.e. directly programmed by the internal register file with LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0]=0), then the half transfer event is not generated, and the transfer complete event is generated when is completed the loading of the LLI1. - 11: at channel level: the complete transfer event is generated at the end of the last LLI transfer. The half transfer event is generated at the half of the data transfer of the last LLI. The last LLI is the one that updates the link address LPDMA_CxLLR.LA[15:2] to zero and that clears all the update bits - UT1, UT2, UB1, USA, UDA, if present UT3, UB2 and ULL - of the LPDMA_CxLLR register. If the channel transfer is continuous/infinite, no event is generated.

The channel transfer is completed without any update of the linked-list DMA register file. Else, this field is the pointer to the memory address offset from which the next linked-list data structure will be automatically fetched from, once the data transfer is completed, in order to conditionally update the linked-list DMA internal register file i.e. possibly LPDMA_CxCTR1, LPDMA_CxTR2, LPDMA_CxBR1, LPDMA_CxSAR, LPDMA_CxDAR and LPDMA_CxLLR. Note: The user should program the pointer to be 32-bit aligned. The two low significant bits are write ignored.
0x5602524C C   FIELD 16w01 ULL: Update LPDMA_CxLLR from memory This bit controls the update of the LPDMA_CxLLR register from the memory during the link transfer. - 0: no LPDMA_CxLLR update - 1: LPDMA_CxLLR update
0x5602524C C   FIELD 27w01 UDA: Update LPDMA_CxDAR from memory This bit controls the update of the LPDMA_CxDAR register from the memory during the link transfer. - 0: no LPDMA_CxDAR update - 1: LPDMA_CxDAR update

If UB1=0 and if LPDMA_CxLLR != 0, the linked-list is not completed. Then LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] is restored to the programmed value after data transfer is completed and before the link transfer. - 0: no LPDMA_CxBR1 update (LPDMA_CxBR1.BNDT[15:0] is restored, if any link transfer) - 1: LPDMA_CxBR1 update
0x5602524C C   FIELD 30w01 UT2: Update LPDMA_CxTR2 from memory This bit controls the update of the LPDMA_CxTR2 register from the memory during the link transfer. - 0: no LPDMA_CxTR2 update - 1: LPDMA_CxTR2 update

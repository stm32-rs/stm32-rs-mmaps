The counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low. Both start and stop of the counter are controlled. 0110: Trigger Mode - The counter starts at a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled. 0111: External Clock Mode 1 - Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter. 1000: Combined reset + trigger mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter, generates an update of the registers and starts the counter. Codes above 1000: Reserved. Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input (TS='100').

Note: 2: It is possible to simultaneously use external clock mode 2 with the following slave modes: reset mode, gated mode and trigger mode. Nevertheless, TRGI must not be connected to ETRF in this case (TS bits must not be 111).

In low-power mode: they are used for wake up from low-power mode on character match. When WUS[1:0] is programmed to 0b00 (WUF active on address match), the wakeup from low-power mode is performed when the received character corresponds to the character programmed through ADD[6:0] or ADD[3:0] bitfield (depending on ADDM7 bit), and WUF interrupt is enabled by setting WUFIE bit. The MSB of the character sent by transmitter should be equal to 1. In Run mode with Mute mode inactive (for example, end-of-block detection in ModBus protocol): the whole received character (8 bits) is compared to ADD[7:0] value and CMF flag is set on match. An interrupt is generated if the CMIE bit is set. These bits can only be written when the reception is disabled (RE=0) or when the USART is disabled (UE=0).

0x41005008 C   FIELD 12w01 OVRDIS (rw): OVRDIS: Overrun Disable This bit is used to disable the receive overrun detection. -0: Overrun Error Flag, ORE, is set when received data is not read before receiving new data. -1: Overrun functionality is disabled. If new data is received while the RXNE flag is still set the ORE flag is not set and the new received data overwrites the previous content of the USART_RDR register. When FIFO mode is enabled, the RXFIFO will be bypassed and data will be written directly in USARTx_RDR register. Even when FIFO management is enabled, the RXNE flag is to be used. This bit can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0).
0x41005008 C   FIELD 13w01 DDRE (rw): DDRE: DMA Disable on Reception Error -0: DMA is not disabled in case of reception error. The corresponding error flag is set but RXNE is kept 0 preventing from overrun. As a consequence, the DMA request is not asserted, so the erroneous data is not transferred (no DMA request), but next correct received data will be transferred. (used for Smartcard mode) -1: DMA is disabled following a reception error. The corresponding error flag is set, as well as RXNE. The DMA request is masked until the error flag is cleared. This means that the software must first disable the DMA request (DMAR = 0) or clear RXNE(RXFNE is case FIFO mode is enabled) before clearing the error flag. This bit can only be written when the USART is disabled (UE=0).
0x41005008 C   FIELD 14w01 DEM (rw): DEM: Driver enable mode This bit allows the user to activate the external transceiver control, through the DE signal. -0: DE function is disabled. -1: DE function is enabled.

0x41005018 C   FIELD 03w01 RXFRQ (wo): RXFRQ: Receive data flush request Writing 1 to this bit empties the entire receive FIFO i.e. clears the bit RXFNE. This allows to discard the received data without reading them, and avoid an overrun condition.
0x41005018 C   FIELD 04w01 TXFRQ (wo): TXFRQ: Transmit data flush request When FIFO mode is disabled, Writing 1 to this bit sets the TXE flag. This allows to discard the transmit data. This bit must be used only in Smartcard mode, when data has not been sent due to errors (NACK) and the FE flag is active in the USART_ISR register. If the USART does not support Smartcard mode, this bit is reserved and forced by hardware to 0 When FIFO is enabled, TXFRQ bit is set to flush the whole FIFO . This will set the flag TXFE (Transmit FIFO empty, bit 23 in the USART_ISR register). Flushing the Transmit FIFO is supported in both UART and Smartcard modes.

0x4100501C C   FIELD 05w01 RXNE_RXFNE (ro): RXNE/RXFNE:Read data register not empty/RXFIFO not empty RXNE bit is set by hardware when the content of the USARTx_RDR shift register has been transferred to the USARTx_RDR register. It is cleared by a read to the USARTx_RDR register. The RXNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USARTx_RQR register. RXFNE bit is set by hardware when the RXFIFO is not empty, and so data can be read from the USART_RDR register. Every read of the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. It is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXNE/RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXNEIE/RXFNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. -0: Data is not received -1: Received data is ready to be read.

It is cleared by a write to the USARTx_TDR register. The TXE flag can also be set by writing 1 to the TXFRQ in the USART_RQR register, in order to discard the data (only in Smartcard T=0 mode, in case of transmission failure). When FIFO mode is enabled, TXFNF is set by hardware when TXFIFO is not full, and so data can be written in the USART_TDR. Every write in the USART_TDR places the data in the TXFIFO. This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty . After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO. (TXFNF and TXFE will be set at the same time).

Note: Any error in the lock sequence aborts the lock. Note: After the first lock sequence on any bit of the port, any read access on the LCKK bit returns '1' until the next MCU reset or peripheral reset.

0x40004404 C   FIELD 24w08 ADD (rw): Address of the USART node These bits give the address of the USART node in Mute mode or a character code to be recognized in low-power or Run mode: In Mute mode: they are used in multiprocessor communication to wakeup from Mute mode with 4-bit/7-bit address mark detection. The MSB of the character sent by the transmitter should be equal to 1. In 4-bit address mark detection, only ADD[3:0] bits are used. In low-power mode: they are used for wake up from low-power mode on character match. When WUS[1:0] is programmed to 0b00 (WUF active on address match), the wakeup from low-power mode is performed when the received character corresponds to the character programmed through ADD[6:0] or ADD[3:0] bitfield (depending on ADDM7 bit), and WUF interrupt is enabled by setting WUFIE bit. The MSB of the character sent by transmitter should be equal to 1.

0x40012C48 C   FIELD 00w05 DBA (rw): DMA base address This 5-bits vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register. Example: ...
0x40012C48 C   FIELD 08w05 DBL (rw): DMA burst length This 5-bit vector defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below). ... Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIMx_CR1. If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIMx_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data is copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data is transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data is also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.

0x5000141C C   FIELD 16w01 LCKK (rw): Lock key This bit can be read any time. It can only be modified using the lock key write sequence. LOCK key write sequence: WR LCKR[16] = ‘1’ + LCKR[15:0] WR LCKR[16] = ‘0’ + LCKR[15:0] WR LCKR[16] = ‘1’ + LCKR[15:0] RD LCKR RD LCKR[16] = ‘1’ (this read operation is optional but it confirms that the lock is active) Note: During the LOCK key write sequence, the value of LCK[15:0] must not change. Any error in the lock sequence aborts the lock. After the first lock sequence on any bit of the port, any read access on the LCKK bit returns ‘1’ until the next MCU reset or peripheral reset.
